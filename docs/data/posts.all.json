So we made a quick pitstop to check out 300 Main on our way into the Exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located with bike lanes immediately behind the building and a bi-directional bike lane a block away, it’s easy peasy to get anywhere by bike from 300 Main.&nbsp; It was simple to stop for a quick visit to show my pals, and from there, we used the handy bike lane on Fort Street to connect us to the Exchange and on to our adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10480\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to our first Nuit Blanche stop, we took the Fort Street bike lane, which becomes a protected bike lane once you cross Portage Avenue.&nbsp; We took this to Adelaide Street, where we popped over to Arts Junktion.&nbsp; They were running a bike decorating spot, where you could also get your bike looked over by The Wrench.&nbsp; Now that our bikes and helmets were all decorated, we were ready for the rest of the night!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10481\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes to the Little Brown Jug Brewery Street party and were greeted with great tunes from DJs set up on their newly upgraded patio, food trucks along the closed street, and plenty of amazing beer.&nbsp; We went inside the brewery to check out their art installation, Moths to a Flame, by Warner Carther.&nbsp; Incorporating transparent glass and light projections, the entire space was lit up with flickering flames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to end the night back in the Exchange, which really is the main centre of Nuit Blanche, so from Little Brown Jug, we cycled up Adelaide Street to the McDermot Avenue bi-directional bike lane, then across Main Street to Stephen Juba Park, along Waterfront Drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10482\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-300x235.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-770x603.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-293x229.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two really great installations along the bike and walking path through Stephen Juba Park.&nbsp; The first we saw was Kasuri, located near the Mere Hotel and created by Takashhi Iwasaki &amp; Joe Kalturnyk.&nbsp; This was a fun, interactive light exhibit, where viewers could turn wheels at the side, which made central pieces move and float, like shimmering blue and pink helix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10483\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next stop was Elucida, created by Biom Lab.&nbsp; Elucida resembled beautiful, colourful patio lanterns strung between the large trees in the park.&nbsp; This effect was emphasized by a group that had set up patio chairs and were hanging out, occasionally chatting with passers by that they knew from the mass of people walking through.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10484\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes out from the thick of people and managed to get a nice little ride along the fenced bike path that leads under the Esplanade Riel Bridge.&nbsp; We stopped at the foot of the bridge, behind the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, to take in Ikuma by Geronimo Inutiq, presented by the Winnipeg Art Gallery.&nbsp; Ikuma from Inuktitut translates to flame, fire, or spark, and this audiovisual program was fascinating to watch and listen to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10485\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many different installations and events taking place at The Forks for Nuit Blanche, and we checked out three of them.&nbsp; Homesick Angels by Joshua Banman, located at the CN Stage, was an interactive exhibit where the audience was projected onto a bank of vintage television sets, becoming angels with coloured halos, laser eyes, and flames in their hands.&nbsp; It was mesmerizing to watch and play with, as well as a little eerie and creepy due to the classical music playing softly at the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10486\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also saw Renaissance of Memory by Nayden, set up on the 5th floor of the parkade.&nbsp; With digital projections as well as little vignettes of tables, toys, and televisions dotted throughout the space, this was a fun piece to wander around and explore while contemplating memory, nostalgia, and sentimental longing for childhood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10487\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our final stop at the Forks was to see Bikes, Lights, Nights by Sputnik Architecture with bikes from the Plain Bicycle Project.&nbsp; The project created an upside-down world of suspended, multicolour, lit-up bicycles high in the tree canopy of the Forks Patio (to the left of the harbour, as you face the river).&nbsp; It was truly magical to see!&nbsp; This installation will run until the end of Culture Days, on October 16, so there is still some time to catch it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From The Forks, we zipped along the bike path that leads to Assiniboine Avenue, taking the bi-directional protected bike lane on Garry Street back to the Exchange District.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10488\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To say the Exchange was packed would truly be an understatement!&nbsp; We explored two exhibits along McDermot. Panotptibot II, by Toxic, captured live images from audience participants, projecting them into the walls of a party in the building behind. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10489\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up the street from Panoptibot II,&nbsp; we visited Pop of Art at Tara Davis Studio Boutique, which featured whimsical window installations by Kami Goertz and Darci Madlung that glowed delightfully in black light.

But don&#8217;t give up on growing just yet! This article is filled with outdoors space ideas for small gardens to be in full bloom in no time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to make do with gardening off my balcony, thinking once I gave up having a yard and garden, I would have to put the trowel away for good, but it turns out there are lots of fun and innovative ways to get a beautiful garden in any space!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Planters</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10430\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the many challenges of having a smaller outdoor area to garden with is you might have lots of space and are not sure how to use it. If you don&#8217;t have a yard and are working off a balcony like many urban gardeners, you will need to get creative. The type of planters you get makes all the difference in your working space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Railing Planters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best solutions for a balcony garden is to use the railing! When it comes to balconies or fenced-in yards, railing boxes are a great option. Not only does it give you a few more feet of planting space than you already thought you had, but it also looks great and provides some shade and privacy from your neighbors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can plant just about anything in a railing planter box, herbs, vegetables, vines, or flowers; most plants will do great in this type of planter, especially under the direction of your green thumb.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hanging Planters</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10432\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great small space solution for your plating needs is hanging baskets and plants. Many plants already come with a hanger; if they don&#8217;t, most of them could thrive in them! Hanging baskets are a great way of utilizing the space above and around you, especially if you have to have most of your plants on a balcony or inside. <a href=\"http://verdeplantdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hanging plants</a> look great and do great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Upside Down Plants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know there are a wide variety of plants you can grow upside down? This has been a trending method for small gardens. Many plants will do great upside down, and you can even get tomatoes, strawberries, and other plants that are already meant to grow that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vertical Gardens</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10433\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A vertical garden is a terrific alternative if you are low on railing or spaces to hang. These are great because you can customize them to your space and your plants. Many plants grow up rather than spreading out and would do very climbing a pallet, lattice, or even railing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Indoor Greenhouse</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have any space to work outside, one of the best options is to have an indoor greenhouse instead! You can customize these to your space or even order them online for less than $100. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indoor greenhouses are controlled spaces to let you grow a wide variety of plants. These are already a popular choice for moving plants from outside to inside for the winter and are great for year-round growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Container Gardening</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10434\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this one may seem like a no-brainer, but something you can do no matter the space you have to work with is container gardening. You don&#8217;t have to need to do a lot of digging, hanging, and stressing about how to grow plants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to fill any space with plants is to grow them individually rather than in a garden. You can get creative and use anything from containers to old shoes to plant in; this way, you are filling your space with what it can thrive with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lighting &amp; Watering</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding gardening, it is important to keep the lighting of the space inside and outside. You want to pick plants that are good for your light situation. If you are in an indoor space or your balcony doesn&#8217;t get direct full sun, then you want to make sure you choose mid to low-light plants. If you want to grow things that require more natural light than your situation offers, there are many ways to give your plants what they need so they thrive in any environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/noma-full-spectrum-led-grow-bulb-a19-0529642p.html?ds_rl=1283573&amp;ds_rl=1283573&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyOuYBhCGARIsAIdGQRMPDxNkezoUBWZoblwettbZwdZ23PPhyCzCK4egD2YlmQpEuY_4oKAaAuwVEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#store=223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">grow bulbs</a>&#8221; from even the dollar store to give them the UV specifications they need. Another great solution is if you already have a UV lamp (or SAD lamp); these work great for giving your plants that extra boost of sunshine they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10435\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You also want to make sure that you are watering them enough and not too much.

Feel free to substitute and improvise wherever you might need to. Things like milk, yogurt, protein powder, and other ingredients may be allergy or diet-sensitive, so just use whatever you typically use when it comes to dairy and protein.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10348\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply swap in your usual milk, yogurt, and protein powder, and feel free to throw in your favorite ingredients anywhere!

Throwing in vitamins you might need more of like C, D, B12, and Omega 3 is a great way to add a nutritional boost to your day and overall health.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10349\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These recipes are sure to help you make the most of the best flavors that summer offers, rich in vitamins, minerals, and seasonal summery flavors that you&#8217;ll want year-round.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Greenville</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Greenville is a healthy play on a delicious favorite, the creamsicle!

Located near Winnipeg and with so much to do, Birds Hill makes for a great day trip or weekend of camping.

Covering over 2000 square kilometers, this section of the province is about 2 hours from Winnipeg, close to the Manitoba &#8211; Ontario border. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10189\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has many popular spots and different options for camping. From cabins to private tent pitching, there is an experience for every kind of camper, from the camper to the glamper. Some of the best campsites in the Whiteshell area are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Westhawk Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Westhawk lake is famous for its unique origin story. The lake was the result of a meteorite crash at this location long ago, which ended up giving Manitoba its deepest lake at 115 km. Westhawk lake is a great spot to camp. It has many campsites close to the lake with water, electricity, and nearby shops and food; Westhawk is a very comfortable camping experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10190\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason why Westhawk is so popular is it is attached to its neighbor, Caddy Lake, but you will have to go through some pretty captivating tunnels to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Caddy Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Caddy Lake is a beautiful place to go camping, especially for the active camper, as it is connected to Westhawk Lake by a series of tunnels. You might need a kayak, canoe, or boat to get to and around the lake and campgrounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10191\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are planning on camping or visiting Caddy Lake, it is well worth the trip. Once you are there, you have the choice of some nice, more secluded campsites near the lake or within hiking distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Falcon Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Falcon Lake is another long-time Manitoba favorite when it comes to camping. Also, within the Whiteshell provincial park and less than a 2-hour drive from Winnipeg, Falcon Lake is one of the most popular campgrounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10192\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring RV and tent campsites complete with electricity, water, showers, playgrounds, and most of which are within walking distance to the beach. Camping isn&#8217;t all there is to do while you are at Falcon Lake with its nearby town of shops, restaurants, and even a golf course.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Otter Falls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nestled up in Manitoba&#8217;s own boreal forest along the Winnipeg River, only an hour and a half from Winnipeg, is Otter Falls.

To your dog, anything can be a potential threat, and barking is their only alarm. Especially when you are living in an apartment, one of the main reasons your dog barks is random noises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To dogs who are sensitive to noise and vibrations, loud neighbors, other animals, kids, and random noises that come with the everyday life of apartment living probably sound a little bit like a purge until you see what is really going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 5 Basic Steps to Successful Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important not to discipline your dog every time they bark, but teach them when and how to instead. You can use these steps to train your dog for almost anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9940\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to have your dog bark trained is by teaching them how to bark properly. Once your dog realizes there is a time and a place for barking, they will start to bark less at seemingly everything. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The 5 Steps to Training Your Dog are:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Observe (The Reaction)</li><li>Introduce (The Sound)</li><li>Replace (Reaction with Command)</li><li>Reward &amp; Repeat</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Observe</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by observing what triggers your dog barking so you can plan what you need to work on. It&#8217;s likely your dog is triggered by the same noises every time so take note of what you need to train your dog on and work on those areas specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Introduce</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next is to introduce your dog to the sound so they can understand where it is coming from. Much of the time, dogs are barking out of curiosity, and you can help them stop barking at the same things in the future by teaching them what the sounds are. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9941\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your dog is triggered by noise in the hall, let your dog watch what is making the noise. If your dog barks at people in the hallway, it is helpful to try and let your dog meet as many of your neighbors as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likely your pet barks at your next-door neighbors the most since they&#8217;re the closest, and your dog can&#8217;t always tell if it&#8217;s their door or yours. So, if your neighbor and your dog are both friendly, try a meet and greet as they&#8217;re coming and going so your dog gets familiar with them and stops barking at them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Training Exercise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that your dog is familiar with the white noise and people of your building, start training them on the sound of your next-door neighbors if that&#8217;s a problem area for your dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have your neighbor leave and come back and work on how your dog reacts. When your dog starts to react to the noise of your neighbor, start by getting your dog to sit and work up to add in your own &#8216;no barking command&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9942\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When your dog hears them and starts to react, get them to sit and stay. Open your door, so your dog can associate the sound with the person. Now that your dog knows that the sound of the keys in the lock next door is just your friendly neighbor who isn&#8217;t a threat, they will start barking less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat the exercise; this time, don&#8217;t open the door right away. Ask your dog to sit and use your no-barking command to get the dog to sit and try to be quiet before opening the door. Your dog probably knows who is on the other side of the door if you do this a few times in a row, so it is important to do this outside of your training exercise as well. As your dog starts to change his reactions, keep refreshing the training and rewarding their efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Barking at Your Door</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next situation you want to train your dog in is when there is a knock on your door. Since your dog thinks he is doing his job by reporting every noise to you, it is important to teach him which noises to look out for and how to react to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9946\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have observed how they are reacting and you have decided how you want them trained, it&#8217;s time to work on replacing their barking with that reaction instead. Training is most effective if you can dedicate time out each day for your dog where you are going to work on the specific things, rather than just trying to correct the behavior as it pops up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you want to do is get their attention by having them sit. Once they&#8217;re sitting, work on getting them to stop barking using your designated command. Reward them for sitting and for any efforts made to stop barking at your word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have them trained to stop barking on command try to repeat the situation a<a href=\"https://www.petsmart.ca/dog/treats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nd reward them for stopping a few times in a row</a>. Try to avoid calling your dog badly, focus on rewarding for changed behavior instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark5-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9948\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In time, your dog will learn to ignore the noises entirely. Once your dog is more used to everything and you start training, you can begin to train them on how they are barking at your company and at you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Knock Training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to train them on is knocks on the door. A big reason why dogs bark is they think you or someone else is at the door. So, you want to teach them how to tell the differences and how you want them to act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way of doing this is with knock training for when the company is at the door and for when you are coming home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When It&#8217;s Company</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a friend stand on the other side of the closed door with you and your dog inside. Have them knock on the door, and you train your dog on how you want them to react to someone knocking on the door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, you want to start with training them to sit and get them to stop barking using their newly taught word.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark8-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9947\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Observe</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your friend to knock, and you observe your dog&#8217;s reaction, try to resist intervening or saying a command, and wait out until they are done, if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Introduce</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduce your dog to what is making the sound. Show your dog that it is actually someone at your door that they are responding to. Don&#8217;t open the door but acknowledge that your dog is alerting you about someone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you want to get them to sit and if you can, stop barking using your word before you open the door. If they still are barking, continue training.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Replace</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you want to do is replace the reaction with what you are teaching them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat your friend knocking and your dog sitting with rewards a few times in a row. Once they are sitting for you, as a reaction, you can teach them a command to go with it that tells them to stop or not to bark when there is a knock at the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark9-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9945\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Have your friend knock again, and when your dog barks, have them sit and tell them the command. Encourage them to stop barking with that command and once your dog stops barking, say the command and praise them, so they associate the word with being quiet and being quiet with praise and reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Repeat &amp; Reward</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some dogs pick it up right away; others may need a few more training days or weeks. It is important to keep training consistent until your dog does get it before they start to go back to their old behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/7-fun-ways-to-celebrate-halloween-with-your-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dogs respond much better to praise and reward</a>.

If your dog feels like you are getting angry at them for barking, this may make your dog&#8217;s barking or other reactions worse and harder to train.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9944\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continue to praise them for the following days to a couple of weeks while they are still fresh with it. Remember, when it comes to changing behavior like barking with your dog, consistency, praise, and patience are key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your dog is only as smart as you make them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training your dog how to react when it is you helps them tell the difference between strangers and you when they are home alone. This will help your dog be more relaxed towards people in the hallway passing by and your neighbors coming and going while you are out as it teaches your dog to recognize when you are home and when it&#8217;s just someone passing by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that your dog is only as trained as you let them be. Every dog is different. There is no magic number of times or amount of time until your dog is totally trained in this way. Usually, a behavior like barking can take a few weeks.

Moving can be hard on everyone in your household, not just us, but our pets are much more affected by moving than we may be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animals do have a harder time with moving than us since they don&#8217;t get the luxury of being able to mentally prepare as we do for something as big as moving to a new home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Think Ahead</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to try and make a move as easy as possible for your feline friend, who can be particularly sensitive when it comes to moving. The best thing you can do is start by thinking ahead. Sometimes we don&#8217;t always get to plan everything, but moving with animals, when possible, the earlier you get yourself and your pets ready, the easier it will be on everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to try and keep our pets in mind a couple of weeks before the moving day if that&#8217;s possible in your situation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg\" alt=\"Cat inside a box\" class=\"wp-image-9901\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Packing up your house can be hard on your cat, so you want to get them used to the process early. Luckily, this can also be fun for your pet with your help. We all know that as soon as there&#8217;s an empty box, cats will be in it or trying to be. After all, the saying goes, &#8220;if I fit, I sit, right&#8221;? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let them have some fun by leaving a couple of empty boxes around where you are packing, so it gets them used to the action and it gives them something to play with. You get bonus points if you want to cut holes in the sides of the boxes to really provide them with something to have fun with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that you can do to get your cat ready for moving out is to have a dedicated kitty-corner set up for them a couple of weeks in advance, so they already have a safe space when moving day comes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat sleeping in a box\" class=\"wp-image-9902\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing to remember is that the transition can only go as smoothly as you help make it. With a bit of preparation and thinking ahead, you can help make this transition as smooth as possible for your cat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting The Old Place Ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If it is possible, it&#8217;s best to have an area or a room set up for your cat that is comfortable and will be packed last. Set this area up with stuff for your cat to help make moving easier on them.

You want to make sure that they will feel comfortable in their new home. If you can, it&#8217;s best to set up a safe area at the new place, too, and take your cat over there to explore the empty house first. This makes it a little less stressful having to spend some time in there while you do the heavy lifting and unpacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would preferably be a room or section of the house or apartment that you can move your cat into with its comfort items and will be set up for its actual use last. Keep your kitty comfy in this area while you set up the house. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let them Explore</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are ready to let your cat explore their newly set up environment, make sure you hold off on taking apart the moving room and try to keep their safe space available for the first little while until they are more comfortable in the new place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat exploring a new room\" class=\"wp-image-9905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1.jpg 1094w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Things to include in the room:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You pretty much want to include whatever you had set up at the old place or to include the same kind of items that you have set up at the old place.

It is our retreat, where we relax and recharge. Being one of the focal points of our homes, many of us strive to create the &#8216;perfect&#8217; bedroom. But when it comes to designing our bedrooms, it can be hard to know where to start. What do you need, what should you think of, are you forgetting anything, what is considered &#8220;the best&#8221; bedroom set up anyways?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom2-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7931\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no exact formula for the best bedroom when designing the perfect bedroom because each space, personality, and lifestyle is different, and you have to do your best with what you can do. When living in a rental property, it may seem like it isn&#8217;t much you can do if you are limited by not being able to paint or change too much. You can turn any space into the perfect bedroom with a few key tips, no matter your bedroom situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors &amp; Textures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the overall aesthetic design of your bedroom, you want to consider your colors and textures first. If you are planning to paint, make sure you choose your colors carefully and consider the color scheme of one of the next major features in the room, like your bedding or rug.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7932\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to go with<a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Ideas/Popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> colors that complement each other</a> without being overbearing. If you already have a common color throughout the room, you might want to choose one that compliments the things you already have. You want to go with colors that are the more neutral, darker, or lighter tones than the colors you will be working with; this compliments your bright colors without using the same ones and being too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For textures, you want to be mindful that you are adding the right ones, but you want to avoid having too many. Textures include things like your rug, pillows, blankets, and patterns. These are all things that have and create their texture, and you want to make sure you choose the same or complementary and not add too many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7929\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t painting, having white walls in your bedroom is a great way to trick the eye into feeling like the space is bigger than it is. If you have a smaller space, it might be better to go with white to make the space feel larger, whereas, in a small room, the wrong or too many colors can make the space feel cramped.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Having the right Frame in Mind</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to consider is your<a href=\"https://www.structube.com/en_ca/furniture/bedroom?page=1&amp;sort-by=position-asc&amp;category_id%5Bfilter%5D=Beds%2C503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> bed frame</a>. If you will be getting a new bed frame, it is essential to think about the space and what you need when choosing one. One thing you can never have enough of in a bedroom is storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7928\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> So if you are low on available closet space or don&#8217;t have room for dressers, then this could be a great solution for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pick the Best Nightstand</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the right bedside table makes all the difference.

The bedroom is the perfect room to use minimalism. The less furniture, accessories, and clutter you have lying around your room, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom6-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7924\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the way things are today, our bedrooms are starting to turn into the space where we spend the most time and maybe even get the most work done, so that may not always be an option. If you do have to have things like a desk, electronics, and your collectibles in your room, you can still use the less is more approach.

Being within 45 minutes from Winnipeg but also having surrounding B-n-B options, you can make the most of either experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fish Famously</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manitoba is famous for a few things, and along with Slurpees, one of our biggest claims to fame is fishing. There are many great places to go fishing. Whether you want to make the day or weekend of it, fishing in Manitoba is another must-do. When it comes to the best fishing spots, there is somewhere to go in any part of the province and cities that make it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Father and son walking with fishing gear towards a lake\" class=\"wp-image-7905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are going to try and make the most of fishing in Manitoba, you can quickly turn your plans into a day or weekend trip. With many of our best hot spots being within 10 to 45 minutes of not only Winnipeg but each other, you can easily plan either a day or weekend of fishing throughout Manitoba this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about these Manitoba attractions is they have much more to offer than a great catch. All of these beautiful views have much more to offer, like hiking, trail walking, resorts, casinos, restaurants, and so much more. No matter what you like to do when you get away, get away to these favorite Manitoba destinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hiking, Beaches, and More Nature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another fun Manitoba getaway idea is to take a shorter trip to one, or more of these Manitoba gems, no matter what you feel like doing. These spots are famous for their nature to see, trails to blaze, and beaches to laze.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Birds Hill Park</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/park-maps-and-locations/central/birds.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Birds Hill Park</a> is a great stop or destination for a day trip. With multiple walking and hiking trails, an artificial beach, and lots of great ways to enjoy nature within 30 minutes of Winnipeg. If you are stopping at Bird&#8217;s Hill Park, you want to make sure you visit the very beautiful and famous Pine Ridge Hollow for dinner or drinks. Pineridge is a unique restaurant experience, with its own local crafty gift shop and goats to pet; it is one of my favorite things to include in any trip to rural Manitoba.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lockport</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Located just at the end of Henderson Highway within 45 minutes from Winnipeg is Lockport. Lockport holds a high reputation for its fishing and diners, making it a great all-day experience. Lockport has always been famous for its two vintage diners, Skinners and the Half Moon. While Skinner&#8217;s historic waterslide may be shut down, you can still enjoy Skinners Diner in full swing serving its world-famous foot-long hot dogs and delicious shakes while listening to your table&#8217;s jukebox in its classic 50s themed (more like preserved) diner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Couple drinking milk shake\" class=\"wp-image-7910\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After dinner and less than just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Skinners is the Half Moon drive-in. With delicious food and shakes, and certainly not any less famous than its sister, is this other local legend. The Half Moon is another vintage Lockport specialty you won&#8217;t want to miss out on your day trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gimli</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gimli.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gimli</a> is one of Manitoba&#8217;s best day trips.

Give her a unique and timeless gift this Mother’s Day by making her the perfect year-round wreath!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ideas out there for this one, from the more traditional to the out of the flower box ideas. This is a very versatile gift idea. These are great because you can tailor them to her taste and decor, and no one knows your mom’s style better than you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fabric wreaths</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your mom is the fun, creative type, this is a perfect choice. Make a wreath that matches whatever space your mom is proudly going to want to display it. A great option is using handkerchiefs and pocket scarves as they are an easy-to-find, affordable, and one-of-a-kind idea when it comes to making a wreath.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"907\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7788\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg 907w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-300x249.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-770x639.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-293x243.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-500x415.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-72x60.jpg 72w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-108x90.jpg 108w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great DIY gift idea you can customize for your mom that she will love is a flower box bouquet. Show your mom not only how much she means to you but how well you know her with a personalized bouquet. Nothing says Happy Mother’s Day like realizing their baby really does know and love them back (almost) as much as they know and love us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show your mom how much you with a personalized bouquet. These personalized DIY bouquets are a perfect fit for Mother’s Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crystal Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or your mom is into crystals, this is a great idea. Not only is it sentimental to put it into a bouquet, but crystals are also incredibly beautiful and personal when it comes from the right person. If your mom likes crystals, the great idea is to go to a holistic store (or order a set on amazon) and pick out a few of your favorite crystals that you know your Mom would love. This is one of the most affordable yet thoughtful ideas when it comes to the DIY gift department.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"927\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7786\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg 927w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure what a crystal is or what to buy, here are some suggestions that fit the energy of Mother’s Day. It is never a bad idea to grab some dried herbs and fresh flowers to throw in and fill the spaces and really make your bouquet complete. You can go to your local metaphysical store or order them online from many holistic realters (amazon included). The great thing about these bouquets is you can make them specific to your mom&#8217;s life, needs, and personality. If you are not quite sure where to start with the crystals and do not want to ruin the surprise by asking her yourself, here are some fail-safe favorites she will definitely love:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Rose Quartz</li><li>Amethyst</li><li>Citrine</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Turquoise</li><li>Clear Quartz</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Rainbow Fluorite</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edible Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another delicious bouquet idea is an edible bouquet! If you ask any mom, they would probably rather have chocolates than actual flowers. A traditional gift like flowers is a nice thought, but they wilt all too soon.

You can find fun ideas and more in-depth instructions online, but making a candle is as easy as 1-2-3-.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pick out your wax, wick, and smell.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The ingredients of a candle are your wax, the wick, the essential oils, and of course, your jar. You can get these online or at any craft store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Prepare</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is melt the wax, mix, and set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melt your wax either directly or through a double boiler system. Once the wax is melted, mix in your essential oils. Whatever method, wax, and size of candle you choose will determine how much you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Package</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that your wax and essential oils are combined, you want to get ready to fill the jar and set the wick. Slowly pour the melted wax and oil into the jar with the wick and let it set. Within 24-48 hours, you will have a personal, beautiful candle ready for your Mother’s Day gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"917\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7781\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg 917w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mom is bound to love any one of these DIY gifts or any other idea you may come up with. When it comes to Mother’s Day, many of us stress about how to best show our moms just how much we appreciate everything they do. A DIY gift is not only easy on your budget but is loving, personal, and bound to show mom exactly how much her answering every little question about laundry and cooking does mean to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to our moms, no one means more to us. It may feel hard to express the level of gratitude you have for everything she does for you. When it comes to gift-giving to your mom, nothing says I love you more than a gift that says, &#8220;I spent time on this,&#8221; and a DIY gift package will scream exactly that. These DIY gifts are amazing alone, or you can mix some of them, and they can also serve you for any other occasion. No matter what you choose, here is hoping you and your mom have a beautiful Mother’s Day this year!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mother’s Day is May 8th, and it seems like no matter how much we think, plan and prepare for it, it still creeps up on us too soon.

When it comes to the spring in Winnipeg, the last thing you want to be is unprepared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may feel like you have to compromise on staying fashionable to be able to remain dry in this weather like there is no point in even trying to stay on trend in the rain, snow, and slush. Don&#8217;t give up on your style just yet!

A great pair of waterproof boots or shoes will make all the difference when it comes to beating the weather and still looking great going from outside to inside. You want to make sure that you choose shoes that are made waterproof to avoid damaging a great pair that isn&#8217;t made to withstand the spring conditions. Most pairs of waterproof shoes are made to resist the snow and slush without damaging the fabric, even without a shoe protector, but you still don&#8217;t want to skip out on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"902\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7755\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png 902w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-900x602.png 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shoe Protector</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what pair of shoes fits your personal style, make sure you keep them protected from the conditions too. Even though most pairs of waterproof shoes can be worn without a protective spray, no problem, when it comes to the fact that you are going through slush and rain, you do want to do what you can to help keep them in the best condition for as long as possible. Using a protecting spray and cleanser that is made for your shoe material will help them resist wear and tear and prevent the fabric from salt and water damage, keeping them looking fresh year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mukluks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mukluks are a popular choice in Winnipeg for very good reason. Not only are the traditional Moccasin made perfect for any of Manitoba&#8217;s conditions, but they also look great and keep you dry and warm in any season. They are great because the rubber sole and waterproof fabrics are made to get you through the worst that mother nature throws at us. I know that I can trust mine to get me from point A to B in the ice and snow or rain and slush without damaging my shoes or my outfit. When it comes to the fur and material of the Mukluks, they are made waterproof to withstand the rain and snow, but you still want to use a protector on these, particularly to keep the fabric and fur in their best condition year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blundstones</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want something a little more versatile that is great right through from spring to fall, Blundstones and similarly styled shoes are a great option for not only the water and slush, but they are light enough to keep wearing throughout the summer, and it&#8217;s a bonus that they look great with almost anything. These are fashionable leather ankle boots that are not only trending but versatile. These are a great style when you have to wear them inside and out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7756\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519.png 1530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rubber Boots</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubber boots are a cute classic option when you can&#8217;t get out of staying in and safe from the rain.

With thousands of cute cuts, styles, and accessories to go with them, you are going to end up wanting to wear your rubber boots this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rubber Boot Liners</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to compromise style for functionality on days when you have to wear your rubber boots. Rubber boot liners are a fashionable addition that goes with any style. Most brands and companies like Hunter have helped make wearing rubber boots from drab to fab. Not only do they add an extra soft liner for your boot, so you don&#8217;t have to walk on rubber, but they look great too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Woman wearing hat and jacket\" class=\"wp-image-7758\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cute Classic Coats</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every spring wardrobe needs a classic coat to complete it.

It goes without saying that everyone should have an umbrella on standby in their closet or bag, just in case of unexpected rainfall or drive-by splashes. Anyone who has waited at a bus stop knows exactly what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pocket Poncho</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Be prepared for unexpected rainfall with a pocket poncho. These are great to keep in your bag or your car just in case you are caught in the rain, without a jacket or umbrella. They have come a long way from the plastic bag look they used to come in. You can find many fashionable options that you will actually want to wear that you&#8217;ll be glad you have on you when you do have to wear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is one of the most fashionable times of the year, but it can be hard to stay that way when it is almost one of the messiest times of the year. But with these great pieces in your wardrobe, you will be ready for anything without having to compromise on style.

But did you know that almost every part of most foods we cook can be used in your garden? From seeds to scraps, there is no such thing as waste when it comes to the products that you cook with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Starting Seeds Right</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to start or add to your indoor garden, look no further for starters than your fridge! You can start your plants by keeping and planting the seeds from the produce that you use throughout your day. There are a few different ways you can use the seeds; no matter which way you choose, you&#8217;ll get results with little effort and no waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Germinate</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One way of starting your seeds is by letting them germinate. This is an easy process but can make all the difference in how your seeds start and plants take later on. This simply gives the seed a head start to grow some roots before putting it in the dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To germinate, all you need is a paper towel, zipper bags, and some water. Simply cut some paper towels into small strips that will fit inside your bag. Moisten the paper towel, put one seed on one piece, and you can probably fold it over into a square. Place the paper towel with the seed into the bag and seal it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7616\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019.jpg 1755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can poke a couple of small air holes, but you will get results without. Make sure you keep checking the paper towel daily to ensure it hasn&#8217;t gone dry; you want to keep the paper towel wet. Within a few days to a week (longer depending on what seed you are planting), roots will appear out of the middle of the seed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now plant this germinated seed in dirt and let the plant grow. It is a good idea to germinate because it makes it easier for the seed to get nutrients and moisture from the dirt once it is planted, since the roots are already exposed, rather than waiting for the seed to open planted in dirt.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plant Seeds Directly</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to or are unable to germinate your seeds, you can plant them directly into the dirt and skip the germination process. You don&#8217;t have to germinate every seed; most of the seeds you will be planting from your kitchen can be planted directly into the dirt and can do just as well as if you had germinated them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is prepare the container where you will be planting or starting the seeds ready with dirt and fertilizer. Place the seeds either into a separate container, or if you are planting more than one together, make sure you space them out to give their roots room to grow. Once the seeds are placed on top of the dirt, you can either cover them with some more dirt or lightly press them into the dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7621\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239.jpg 1623w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to make sure that you are careful to keep the seeds wet while they are just starting this way as well, especially if you are skipping the germination process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that until you start to see the growth, you want to keep either your germinated seeds or starters wet to help the root grow through the seed shell. You can do this with a spray bottle of water and spray the paper towel squares and the dirt when they start to dry out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Regrowing Herbs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great thing that you can use to regrow is the stems from your fresh herbs! Many herbs that we grow and only use the leaf of, such as mint, sage, basil, and many more, can regrow roots from where the leaves and stamps are picked off of.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7617\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273.jpg 1774w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is cut off the leaves/ stems at the bottom of one stem or piece and place it in water. Anywhere from one to three weeks, you will start to see roots coming from where the leaves were plucked, and stems were cut off. Once the roots are long and strong enough, you can plant them and enjoy the new addition to your indoor garden!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Home Made Fertilizer &amp; Compost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the rest of the scraps from your kitchen to make your fertilizers and compost to help your plants thrive and save on eliminating food waste. Things like eggshells, used coffee grounds, vegetables, fruit peels, and much more can be used to help the rest of your indoor garden thrive!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Home Made Fertilizer<br>DIY Compost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I noticed worked best with my indoor garden was using the scraps of my food as compost for later planting purposes. All you have to do is take a bag of soil that reseals (or a container) and continue to throw scraps from your fruits and veggies in with the dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down the road, when you are ready to plant more or transplant what you have started, you will have beautiful soft nutrient-loaded soil that your plants will love.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7618\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Egg Shells and Coffee Grounds</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest fertilizers to make is from eggshells and coffee grounds. Simply mix your used coffee grounds and eggshells (instead of throwing them in the garbage anyway) and use this as a fertilizer for your indoor garden. This is a great combination because it helps give them calcium and nitrogen, two things that are essential to giving any plant a healthy boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Banana Tea, Anyone?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common kitchen scrap that is loaded with nutrients for your garden is banana peels! You can use banana peels as a fertilizer in a few ways. If you have a compost bag going, you can add it to that, or you can make your fertilizer to give your garden a direct boost of potassium, which goes great with the nitrogen and calcium they had from the rest of your breakfast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a variety of ways out there to make this fertilizer, commonly called banana tea. The easiest way to do this is by making it in a jar. Collect about 3-5 banana peels, depending on the size of your jar; fill the jar with water, seal, and wait. After a few days to about a week, you can remove the banana peels and use the water to water your plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest struggles with indoor gardens usually is the lack of natural lighting available. Light is an essential part of your indoor garden&#8217;s success, so if you can, try to keep them near the window or choose low-light plants to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7619\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing you can do for your plants, especially when they are just starting, is to get them a &#8220;grow bulb.&#8221; You can get these almost anywhere, dollar stores, hardware stores, and of course, nurseries. This is a bulb or set of bulbs that you put in a designated lamp or light fixture that gives off the proper waves that most plants need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pay Attention To Your Gardens Needs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to our plants, overfeeding and watering our plants is one of the easiest mistakes to make. It can feel like we are doing something wrong when our plants don&#8217;t need any fertilizer or water, but when it comes to caring for your garden, less is more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pay attention to the soil of your garden and the leaves of your plants, you will come to learn when you need to feed and water them. If the top layer of soil is still moist for most plants, you don&#8217;t need to water it yet; wait until it has dried out a little. Make sure not to overwater your plants, especially sensitive ones such as succulents and cacti.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7620\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is just as easy to over-fertilize as it is to overfeed. Pay attention to the leaves and stems of your plants; they will tell you if they have had too much or not enough. When it comes to fertilizer when we are recycling our scraps, it is easy for us to overdo it, and you want to be careful that you are paying attention to how much you are feeding them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overfeeding can cause discoloration and other issues to appear on your plants&#8217; leaves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your indoor garden will now not only be as easy as ever, but your plants will grow and thrive more than you dreamed they could if you start to include these great tips in your home gardening routine.

I spend much of my free time walking our city sites, river walks and downtown sidewalks with my trusty pup, soaking in the unique history, architecture and culture Winnipeg has to offer.","url":"https://livingat300main.ca/author/jbell/"}]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7611"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/users/25"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=7611"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7611/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7677,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7611/revisions/7677"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media/7617"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=7611"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=7611"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=7611"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":7581,"date":"2022-03-31T15:00:02","date_gmt":"2022-03-31T15:00:02","guid":{"rendered":"https://livingat300main.ca/?p=7581"},"modified":"2022-03-25T15:59:32","modified_gmt":"2022-03-25T15:59:32","slug":"spring-cleaning-your-life","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"/spring-cleaning-your-life/","title":{"rendered":"Spring Cleaning Your Life"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Making changes to our daily schedules and changing old habits can be hard and overwhelming, which is why using a specific time of the year, as the start of the New Year or the start of Spring, make it a little bit easier to attempt to make small changes to our lifestyles.

And as you clean up each sphere, you will feel you can breathe a little easier, feel just that bit less anxious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest place to start is your physical space. It’s tangible, and you will feel the difference almost immediately. A cluttered environment means cluttered thoughts, so the best way to clear up your mind is to clear up your living space. Start with one part of the apartment; your closet would be the best place to start because we all seem to love hoarding clothes, and they might be the easiest items to give away.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spr7-1024x678.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7583\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-1024x678.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-300x199.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-770x510.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-293x194.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-500x331.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7.png 1294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When cleaning your closet, make a general rule in your head. If you haven’t used an item for the last two years, chances are you are not going to be using it again. And plenty of people out there would really appreciate the donation. Tick that ‘do a good deed today’ check box in your head and start packing that box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;When that’s done, move to another part and so on. That way, you won’t feel too overwhelmed and feel like you are throwing half your belongings away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do away with old pieces of furniture you are no longer using and give yourself the chance to just take in your surroundings. To be honest, minimalism is so underrated. The fewer things you own, the less clutter there is, the less you have to clean up, and the more space and time you can enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sp6-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7584\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend some time in the kitchen. Get rid of any old saucepans, cups, cutlery that you don’t want to keep.&nbsp; If you are looking to become more focused on good health and using products that are good for the environment, a good place to start might be low-quality plastic containers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring cleaning your life also means doing away with anything else in your life that is negatively impacting you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be toxic relationships, a work environment that impacts your mental health, or taking on more than you can handle. Sometimes we end up biting more than we can chew only because we could not say ‘no’ when we should have. Make use of this time and exercise to step back and reassess what you are comfortable within your current schedule. Make a plan on how to best remove tasks you no longer have the time or energy for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be able to feel your best and do your best, you need to make sure your own cup is full. Because remember, you can’t pour out of an empty cup. So make time every day to do something that keeps you going, something that you like doing, just for yourself. It could be a long shower, curling up with a good book, painting or simply sitting with a cup of tea without a list of things to do going on in your mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring clean your biggest asset, your body! Take a good look at your diet. Do you drink enough water? Are you eating a balanced diet? Are there any small steps that you can take to improve your diet and your physical health?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spr4-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7587\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1536x1025.png 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1400x934.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-500x334.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4.png 1590w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A good diet goes hand in hand with some form of exercise. If you are not into doing any intense workouts, try basic yoga to improve your energy levels as well as your mood. Start with just ten minutes a day. You will begin to notice the difference in a few days. Consistency is key. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meditation also works wonders to ease the mind and help with developing awareness. It can improve the quality of your sleep and make you feel more in control of your thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, you are your biggest cheerleader. So take some time to write positive notes for yourself and leave them around your apartment; on the bathroom mirror so there is a pick me up note right before you start your day, something on the fridge for you to glance at as your struggle to race through breakfast and something next to your bed, so you can end the day knowing tomorrow can and will be better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spr5-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7586\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Any spring cleaning will be incomplete without a thorough cleaning of your social media accounts. Take some time to out to unfollow people and accounts that end up promoting mindless consumerism and make you feel negative. You don’t need to mindlessly browse through all your stories to find out what is going on in other people’s lives. Because that time can be better spent investing in your own life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Don’t be scared to unfriend people you no longer want to be in touch with.&nbsp; And maybe, just maybe, think about clicking that ‘Deactivate’ button that is glaring at you from your phone screen. Maybe your mind, body and soul need to deactivate from the façade on social media so you can feel the reality of the cool evening air and the warmth of the coffee mug as it rests in your palms. Try it. You might find it more addictive than the Metaverse.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making changes to our daily schedules and changing old habits can be hard and overwhelming, which is why using a specific time of the year, as the start of the New Year or the start of Spring, make it a little bit easier to attempt to make small changes to our lifestyles.

Not all places have the luxury of walk-in closets, so any closet space is precious. This spring, you will want to take advantage of the countless ways to get your closet organized this Spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to get your closet organized is by changing how you store the clothes in your closet. There are a ton of things out there to help you get every bit of space you can from your closet. Try using over-the-door shoe racks or t-shirt holders, scarf organizers, hanging organizers for accessories things like that; it is a great way to get some extra space and keep it clean. Other useful things like clear bins, foldable fabric boxes, and vacuum bags are great for keeping seasonal or rarely used items away and storing them a breeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try these to help your get your closets organized this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over the door shirt organizer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closet door racks are great for extra shirts, scarves, shoes, or anything you have some extra out of the drawers and off the floor by hanging them on the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hangar stacker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty hangars take up a lot more space than we maybe think. If this is one of your usual closet catastrophes, try using a hangar stacker to keep them all together without having to untangle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scarf Hangars</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best fashion accessories is one of the worst things to store. Scarves are deceptively bulky, and it may seem like there is no good way of storing them. Scarf hangers are a great way to organize your scarf collection and give you a lot of your space back too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fabric Boxes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foldable fabric boxes are almost essential when it comes to organizing your closet. These boxes are great for keeping things together and out of the way in versatile fabric boxes, especially if closet and dresser space is at a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7574\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Living Room</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The living room is a great place to get organized in your Spring cleaning this season. It may seem like we have more useless cords, remotes, and who knows what else more than ever, but with these organizational hacks, people will be wondering if your living room has even been lived in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arm Rest Caddy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The armrest caddy is one of the most useful things you can get for your living room. Keep your remotes and anything else you might need to organized, hidden, but close by with an over-the-arm rest controller caddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cord organization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cords may be an essential way of life, but they are bulky and an eyesore though it is possible to keep them out of sight and out of mind. Keep your cords clean and hidden with cord boxes and organization techniques like covers that stick to and match your wall charging stations; there are countless ways to fix your cord catastrophe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storage table</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel impossible to keep a clean living room table; after all, it is one of the most used surfaces in the house. That&#8217;s why the coffee table is the perfect place to get some extra storage. Consider getting a coffee table that either has 2 tiers or storage underneath for you to keep all the extras.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7575\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883.jpg 1379w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Kitchen</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel near impossible to keep an organized kitchen. Our cupboards get full of so many open boxes and bags of miscellaneous spices and ingredients, but with these clutter cutters, even you are going to be impressed with your kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Containers Are Key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to keep an organized mess in your kitchen is by utilizing things like clear containers and jars. Open bags and packages use up a lot of our precious counter and cupboard space. Help maximize it as much as possible by putting all those open half-used bags of spices, flours, and everything else into containers. You&#8217;ll know where everything is, and it will be fresh when you go to use it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Magnet Magic</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magnetic strips are an amazing way to kick up your kitchen organization game. Instead of having knives and other utensils on the counter or taking up all of your drawer space, try adding a magnetic strip for a stylish way to keep your knives organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wall mounts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your brooms, mops, and other cleaning supplies organized by installing wall mounts for them. Many of us have to keep our brooms, mops, and other cleaning supplies in a closet or shoved in a corner. Wall is mounting these things instead to keep them handy, out of the way, and off the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7576\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bathroom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bathroom is a key place to get organized this spring. It is probably the room in the house that is used and cleaned the most and yet is somehow always still the messiest from all of the odds and ends that take up all of our counter and shower space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many great ways to organize your bathroom. Try any of the favorite bathroom storage hacks below this spring. Never underestimate organizing your cosmetics and toiletries with on-the-counter holders, drawer boxes, and so many more ways to save the most space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Toiletry Dispensers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give bottles the boot with all mounted toiletry dispensers. These dispensers just stick on the wall fill up with your favorite shampoo, conditioner, body wash. These help keep the bottles out of the way and give you that much more space in your shower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shower caddy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you struggle with the shelving storage of pretty much every shower, then you are just like the rest of us. Nothing a shower caddy can&#8217;t fix! Add some extra shelf space in your shower by hanging a shower caddy over your shower head for added storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over the toilet rack</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t go wrong with an over toilet rack for your towels and toiletries, especially if your bathroom is already short on space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7577\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387.jpg 1762w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bedroom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bedroom is full of hidden ways to get and stay organized this spring. Try any of these great ways of organizing your bedroom this spring-cleaning season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Under the bed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the bed storage is one of the best ways to organize your bedroom. Under your bed is the perfect place to keep bins and vacuum-sealed bags of your seasonal stuff, blankets, the stuff that has been taking up precious closet cargo. Try to get a bed frame that has extra storage below and around it to make the most of your bedroom furniture. If you don&#8217;t have a bed with built-in storage, you can keep your extra blankets, seasonal clothes, and everything else under the bed. Storage hacks like clear bins and vacuum bags will go a long way when it comes to keeping things under the bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Displays</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to cut back closet clutter is by changing how you are keeping your hat and shoe collections. These are things that somehow seem to take up the most space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save space (and show off a little) by hanging your hat and shoe collections on the wall. Hanging your hats gives you much more of your closet space back, and it also looks great. I have this done in my apartment, and guests love this idea. If you have a lot of hats, you can save space by putting them on the wall with sticky hooks or push pins and arranging them on the wall for a hat display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your shoes, get some floating shelves or cubes and have your lovely shoe collection safe while keeping it out of your closets and off of the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cut Corners With Corner Shelves</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bedrooms don&#8217;t always have a lot of floor (or wall) space these days. You can save a lot of space and up your aesthetics with corner shelves! Just a few square shelves in the right spots make a huge impact on your room.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7578\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883.jpg 1677w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Workspace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re working out of a home office or utilize your extra table as your workspace, keeping it organized keeps working effortlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Attachable Desk Drawers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your table or desk doesn&#8217;t have drawers, there are solutions for that.

And there are quite a few ways so you can pick and choose depending on your taste and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7565\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1.jpg 1241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My personal favorite is the diffuser. So subtle and yet so powerful. And honestly, there is something so calming about looking at all the mist that flows out. I often catch myself just staring at it.  You can choose whatever combination of essential oils you like, or you can swap them around depending on your mood and time of day. Something is calming like peppermint for a meditation or yoga session and maybe some lavender for when you want to curl up on the sofa with a cup of green tea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to try out different scents till you find ‘the one.’ You can also choose to put smaller diffusers around the apartment and in the bathrooms when you’re having guests over. Everyone loves to be greeted with a fresh scent, whether they are entering the main door or the bathroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of aromatherapy are numerous. It can help you relax, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety—all great things in today’s stressful and fast lifestyle. After a tiring day, you would want to come back to your little haven. And let’s be honest, no one likes a stinky haven. And the good news is, there is no one right way to make your home smell good. There are so many options out there that you’re bound to find one that suits your needs and lifestyle. You just have to take the first step to find out what works best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7566\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scented candles are another way to make your living space smell heavenly, especially if you’re the kind of person who likes warm tones. You can try out vanilla if you want to go subtle, cinnamon for a spicier feel, and flowery scents if you really want to feel like spring is in the air or in your living room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candles also really add some personality to a living room. They come in different sizes and styles, so you can choose a minimalistic version that is not too conspicuous or go for something fancy if you really want people to notice the source of the heavenly scent that will be coming from your home this spring!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1344\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7567\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3.jpg 1344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Burning incense can also be an interesting way to freshen up the scent in your home. It can help to reduce anxiety and would go well with a meditation session. The scented smoke would work well for a spiritual purpose, but if you are sensitive to inhaling smoke, then this might not be the best option for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a DIY kind of person and like to keep things basic, just throw in some orange and lemon slices with cinnamon sticks in a pot of water and let it boil. Your kitchen will smell of citrusy and cinnamon goodness in no time! Or better yet, bake a batch of cookies if you really want some authentic vanilla and cinnamon scent in the kitchen and also have something to munch on while you enjoy the yummy smell!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If candles and diffusers are too much for you and you are looking for a more subtle way to improve the way your home smells, then reed diffusers might be your best bet.

Let the playing commence. May the best leprechaun win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A St. Patrick’s Day spin on Bobbing For Apples</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know and love the Halloween age-old tradition of bobbing for apples, right? Well, if you want to challenge your guests this year, try having them bob for The Lucky Charms. Get bowls of lucky charms, have one person blindfolded on each side, and try and pick out the marshmallow pieces of the lucky charms the fastest. May the quickest step dancer win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next word of advice is to revisit the food and drinks listed in this article and make sure you have plenty of those on hand. Check out our two favorite St. Patricks Day contests to include at your 2022 bash.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Costume Contest</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold a contest for the best St. Patricks Day costume.

Get participants to make their best the cuff Irish and St. Patrick Day-themed cocktails, and may the best one win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go on a street crawl</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If none of the above fit your Irish appetite or you rather keep to yourself, try celebrating by going on your street crawl. Make sure you throw on some green to avoid getting pinched and embark on your own St Patrick&#8217;s day adventure. Try taking a walk through the city where St Patrick&#8217;s day is in full swing, and enjoy watching the city turn green!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>St. Patricks Day the Self Care Way; Keep Calm and Celebrate St Patrick!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rather stay in and keep calm this St Patricks day but still want to stay in the holiday spirit, try indulging in some St Patrick day themed self-care. Start by brewing yourself an Irish coffee, run a bath with a goat’s milk soak and green-themed oils like peppermint, and let the stress melt away to the sounds of relaxing Irish music.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hangover the Irish Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While St Patrick’s Day is a nationally beloved holiday, it is not exactly a nationally absorbed holiday in the way of anyone having the day off. Unlike New Year’s Eve, where we all have a national hangover day on January 1st (and most places on the 2nd too), not too many places close on St. Patricks Day. If you find yourself hungover and have to go to work this St. Patricks Day, try one of these Irish remedies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"941\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sp3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7534\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3.jpg 941w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Full Irish Breakfast<br>-Bacon<br>-Eggs<br>-Sausages<br>-Black Pudding<br>-Beans<br>-Fried Tomatoes</li><li>Irish Coffee<br>The best cure to a hangover for many the next day is the good old classic coffee.

And it&#8217;s not just for the environment. It provides an efficient alternative to driving, whether it can help alleviate concerns about parking or digging your car out in wintertime while saving money on gas prices! Let&#8217;s not forget that biking and walking also promote healthy living by getting some daily body movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Host with the most</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who live Downtown often forget how much their residences appeal to friends and family members who want quick access into the city. Rather than lamenting another trip out into sleepy suburbs, your friends and family will be waiting with excited anticipation for your next visit!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-1024x614.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7472\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-300x180.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-770x461.jpg 770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The city is your oyster.

Having an organized space helps get all that stuff out of the way while <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/why-an-organized-home-aids-relaxation-3144742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">improving your mental health</a>. Maximizing space becomes an even more important feature in an apartment setting if you lack in-building storage or live with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tackling the mess can be overwhelming. The key to getting it done is starting small and applying the same principles to each space as you go along. There really can be a method to the madness! Here are a few tips to keep your area organized, starting in a more inconspicuous part of your house – your linen closet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to keeping any space clean is to purge. According to <a href=\"https://www.organizedinteriors.com/blog/home-organization-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">research</a>, we only use about 20% of the things we own. So what happens to the other 80%? It is probably in a storage unit or the back of a closet if you&#8217;re like me. We all do it. You know the shirt in the back that you wore once to the festival you never went to again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, your linen closet is probably hiding secrets of a past self, saying, &#8220;one day I will &lt;insert idea here&gt;.&#8221; Purging will give you the space to evaluate what is essential and what to dump. The cup of buttons I found in the back of my linen closet quickly became an art project. Get crafty with things you can&#8217;t bring yourself to throw out. Another option is to recycle what is still usable for someone else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try looking up places in your city that will recycle odds and ends. Small appliances, electronics, and old smoke alarms can go to local <a href=\"https://greendeal.ca/recycling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">green recycling depots</a>. So, grab a couple of bins and start throwing things over your shoulder like a 90s cartoon. Here is a tip: if you have to ask, &#8220;what was this for again?&#8221; then it is probably not something you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NL8-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7438\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Purging is only the first step. It prepares you for the next stage of this project – sorting through what you want to keep. This is the part where you go back to grade two math and start pairing like items with like items. Put all the towels in one pile, then the lint rollers in another. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are happy with your groups, start putting things into <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/cat/clothes-boxes-10565/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closet-organizing storage bins</a> of different shapes and sizes. Storage bins help to create dedicated spaces that help control clutter. Containers with lids or stackable bins also help to create more vertical space in your closet and more room to play with. Having dedicated compartments for specific things also helps with the visual appeal of the closet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give the illusion of organization even if the bin is just stray pins and random items. That said, I like a bin-in-bin situation where each of my small-item buckets contains several other open top-boxes for things like clothespins and laundry bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to storage boxes, try out some space-saving bags, hooks, and shelves to maximize space while reducing mess. Wire shelving again helps with creating vertical space on your shelves. I like to roll my linens to help with organization. With tall and deep closet shelves, this means that I can have towels underneath the wire shelf and face towels on top (organized by color, of course). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vertical space is essential if you have a multi-person home or do not have a lot of storage space. You can also test out vacuum seal bags to give you even more room. Finally, wall hooks and Velcro strips allow you to hang things on the back of the door or the sidewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NL7-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7437\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn&#8217;t enough to only have the bins in place. If you want to stay organized and keep everyone at home in the loop, it is important to label everything. Many storage bins will come with label space that will help keep your space organized. If that doesn&#8217;t work, a bit of painter&#8217;s tape and a sharpie can do the trick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labeling your boxes ensures that you won&#8217;t have to open each box to find it when you are looking for something. In addition to labels, I also like having dedicated shelves. Knowing that towels are always on the top and detergent is on the bottom helps maintain your new organizing system and creates habits that anyone can follow. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how you choose to organize your space, take it slow, grab a glass of wine, and enjoy the process.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spending more time at home has probably meant that you have had more time to rethink your space.

Are you thinking about setting resolutions for 2022? With all the lockdown and pandemic talk (still) happening, this might be more difficult than in previous years. Are the gyms going to close again? Will I be able to start that new food lifestyle? Will I even be able to make it to Tulum this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we all wait for that &#8220;new normal,&#8221; we have the opportunity to reframe how we experience where we are now. For me, 2021 presented me with the chance to rethink resolutions. I decided to focus on building in more holistic practices rather than individual goals. I swapped out &#8220;gym three times a week&#8221; with &#8220;move daily.&#8221; Building better habits into day-to-day activities allowed me to actually hold to my new year&#8217;s resolutions. Because of this, I have been happier and healthier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7342\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1.jpg 1625w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are five resolutions worth keeping and implementing into your daily life. There are a few things to remember when setting any resolutions. First, set a limit on how many goals you are looking to make. Next, make your resolutions specific. When I changed my resolution to moving daily, I also made sure to add for a minimum of 15 min a day. For all you fitness buffs, I know 15 min is about half of the recommended movement time, but the pandemic was hard and, I sat a lot. This brings me to the next point, start small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few of us can successfully go from 0 to 100 overnight. By the end of 2021, I was moving for over an hour a day, but I started at 15 minutes. Finally, stay open and get help. Having an accountability partner (or app) helps hold you to your goals. The extra support is helpful when those resolutions start to feel hard. Change can be challenging. Having someone to support you through change is an important aspect of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few resolutions to help you along your journey in 2022. Good luck, you&#8217;ve got this! &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Move</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, this is not a traditional resolution of going to the gym three times a week. This resolution is just about moving your body, even if it is up and down the hallways a couple of times. The past few years have been passed sitting in a chair sitting for many people. It&#8217;s time to get active again. The physical and mental benefits of activity of any type are important, but how we get the activity is less important.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b3-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7337\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1.jpg 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad always parks in the furthest spot at the store so he can get his steps in. I prefer a dance party in the living room. It doesn&#8217;t always have to be treadmills and barbells. The key to this resolution is to commit to moving your body regularly simply. Let the type of movement you are doing evolve as you get stronger and keep going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pay it forward</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This resolution is all about finding space to give back. The pandemic has been draining for many people. Some of us have experienced it much worse than others. I know that every canceled holiday plan has been exhausting for me. This is why acts of kindness need to be built into your new year. Think about those videos of people buying meals for someone they have never met or pets howling, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b4-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7338\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1.jpg 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those little moments where you want to say, &#8220;aww, that&#8217;s so sweet.&#8221; Try building in a giving practice into your new year. We need more kind moments to continue through the pandemic. Try leaving a note (or text) for someone you know has been having a hard time. Donate to or volunteer for a local organization. Or call your mom. Whatever it is, everyone could use an act of kindness in their lives. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do one green thing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global warming is real. The abnormally hot summers say so. This year, commit to being a bit more green. This doesn&#8217;t mean you immediately have to become a master composter. It means trying out high-efficiency bulbs and recycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b5-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7339\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2.jpg 1750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or it could mean walking to the store (and getting in movement minutes). I am working on switching out cleaning products to eco-friendly products. I also used last year to start a garden. This resolution is about finding a way to get a bit greener.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start a mindfulness practice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness practices are not new. There are traditions dating back thousands of years. This is why I can bet there is something out there that would work for every person. There is enough diversity in practices to create something that feels true for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b6-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7340\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1.jpg 1479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of mindfulness are endless – stress relief, better sleep, improved mental, physical, and social health, to name a few. For some, diving into a yogic lifestyle and meditation is the way to go. For others, the namastes and cross-legged poses aren&#8217;t a fit. Mindfulness is really about slowing down and experiencing every moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many apps and sites where you can get the how-tos of developing a practice but again, start small. Maybe starting practice for you this year means breathing deeply three times when you feel mad, anxious, or overly excited. For others, mindfulness this year could mean cutting out multi-tasking and focussing in on one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try something new</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use this year as an opportunity to check something off your bucket list. With businesses reopening and a growing number of online classes from around the world, now is a great chance to learn that new skill. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7341\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this your mental workout.

Houses covered with snow, the Christmas feeling, and the chilly weather make this season magical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also the coziest of the season. The cold push us back home, and there’s a unique vibe when drinking a warm cup of coffee in the comfort of your winter-decorated home. If you didn’t have time or energy to make your home your winter wonderland and are feeling overwhelmed, I’ve curated a few -easy- tips to make your home décor a little more winter-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7220\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Light, Scent, and set the Mood with Candles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing sets more a cozier mood than candles. Used all year long, your candle’s size, shape, and smell vary depending on your taste. However, the idea is to use it to highlight those winter prime spaces, like fireplaces, mantels, and shelves, to make your apartment or house even cozier. Keep the colors on the light and bright side for a minimalist look. Scents like peppermint, pine, and apple are great options to fill your home with the perfect winter vibe. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7221\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make a wreath</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The front door is the first impression of your home. So why leave it out of the décor plan? The good thing about wreaths is that many options for inexpensive DIYs are available, so there are no excuses not to give them a try. &nbsp;Experiment with different materials like grapevine, Styrofoam, pinecones, or even cardboard. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7222\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Throw a blanket</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! It’s that time of the year where we are so proud of our chunky knit blanket. If you don’t have the chunky one, any type will do it. Throw it on your sofa, stool, or bed. The blanket will add a touch of winter décor to your space with an inexpensive, warming, and elegant result.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7223\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowers, plants, and greenery</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t wait for the Spring to enjoy your pretty flowers. Many flowers and plants survive and even thrive during winter’s cold weather<a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/amazing-houseplants-that-will-survive-the-cold-weather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">. <strong>A few days ago, we posted the best houseplants to survive the winter</strong></a>, but now we invite you to give it a try and decorate your home with flowers, foliage, or plants that will brighten up the cold season. To create a cozier look, choose earthier or white colors for flowers. Another good idea is to create a winter arrangement with bright foliage, branches, and berries.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7224\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Table décor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter, especially the holiday season, is a perfect time to celebrate with family and friends. Whether you are throwing a Christmas party or simply adding beauty to your dining room, there are many ways to style your table. From centerpieces made of greenery, candles, and pinecones to simple ideas like napkin arrangements or DIY paper houses, your table décor is a must to give a stylish feel to your winter wonderland.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7225\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bring the Outdoors in</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun idea to give your house a wintery feeling is to bring outdoor elements inside. Rocks, firewood, pinecones, and leaves can create a cozier environment and add a cabin vibe to your favorite space. Keeping firewood displayed or winter greenery in ceramic vases adds another layer of natural textures to even the most urban of the homes.   </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter is just around the corner, and this is the most beautiful season for many winter-lovers.

The rich nuttiness of the oats with some milk and a bit of brown sugar are undefeated against a cold winter morning. A slow cooker is best for cooking steel-cut oats that are a bit denser and can keep the chewiness after being cooked over a long period. On average, you will want to use 3 ½ to 4 cups of liquid for every one cup of oats depending on the size of your cooker and your desired texture.  For the liquid, you can use water or any of your favorite kinds of milk. I prefer a mix of almond milk and coconut milk. After that, it is just choosing your toppings! From classics like pecans and raisins to items like carrot and coconut chips, oatmeal allows you to mix and match to your heart&#8217;s content. Don’t forget to throw in a sweetener of choice and a few herbs or spices like cardamom or nutmeg. Get creative and try something new. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.ihearteating.com/overnight-crock-pot-carrot-cake-oatmeal/\">overnight slow cooker carrot cake oatmeal</a> recipe by Kate Dean from I Heart Eating and try a little dessert for breakfast this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beans will make you dance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID brought on a lot of changes for everyone. For me, given the extra time I had at home, I decided to transition into a vegetarian lifestyle. What this meant was experimenting with new recipes and very often, beans. Cue the slow cooker. Over the last year, I have tried a variety of slow cooker bean dishes from chili to stew. Now, when I think about a go-to slow cooker meal, I immediately think of a warm chickpea coconut curry! This dish is a staple in my meal plan, popping up every couple of months. The rich curry flavor always transports me to another, much warmer, place, and in the dead of winter, that is where I want to be. Served on a bed of rice or with a side of naan bread, this dish is all comfort. I often pair mine with some garlic roasted green beans or oven-roasted broccoli. To get your curry on, pick up some potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, ginger, and coconut milk. Again, thanks to the one-pot meal idea, all you have to do is prep the veggies and dump them all into the pot.

But did you know that your slow cooker can also make a variety of desserts and types of bread? That’s right, brownies, focaccia, French toast, and cakes can all be prepared in a slow cooker. As a big fan of dessert, slow cooker puddings and pies have been an exciting new way to cook some of my favorite sweets. I find that cooking with a slow cooker means that burning my baking is much less likely thanks to the slow cooking time. I also love that using the slow cooker frees up the oven for other tasks, which comes in handy during the busy Christmas baking season. Making dessert in a slow cooker is a bit more involved than a one-pot meal. You still need to prep the ingredients outside of the pot as you normally would, but then you can stick it into the pot to cook.

While I often choose a cup of tea, sometimes I like to change things up. Hot toddies mulled wines, and boozy hot chocolates are all beverages that help warm me up while I wind down. These are also all drinks that can easily be prepared in a slow cooker! I mix mine at lunch which guarantees an after-dinner serving time that is still hot out the pot. With slow cooker beverages, we can return to the one-pot meal idea and get creative with mix-ins. Want to try a mint hot chocolate, or ginger-spiced mulled wine? You can easily adapt any base recipe with your favorite flavors. Just stay open to the possibilities and adjust along the way.

But to create that real winter hygge (a Danish word meaning a quality of coziness and comfort that creates a feeling of contentment or well-being according to dictionary.com) you need to set the scene. While your slow cooker can make food items, it can also make candles, lotion bars, and soaps! That’s right, you can set the scene for your winter wonderland with these DIY household items. When creating a non-food product in your cooker, you will want to be sure to use a liner where possible to avoid cross-contamination and for easy clean-up. These are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased online or from the kitchen aisle in your local grocery store. I love candle-making. They make great gifts, are pretty easy to make, and they smell great! Soaps and lotion bars are also great gift ideas and allow you to exercise your creative side.

What better way is there to ring in the holiday than with your best and brightest around a table for a couple of sips and a few bites to eat, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your date set, the guest list firm, and the invitations sent, it’s time to narrow in on the details of this party. These holiday themes are packaged and paired nicely with your food, decoration, and activity options. While Christmas is a theme of its own, changing things up will help to keep things fresh and make your party stand out. I am offering this list of party ideas to help you ramp up your holiday season as you get ready to wind down the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7268\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RWG Christmas</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, Christmas is its own theme and allows you to keep it easy by grabbing all the green, gold, white, and red you can from any of your local shops. Seven-foot self-lighting tree? Check. Popcorn tinsel? Done. An RWG Christmas (red, white, and green) gives you the chance to slide into the holiday season easily with pre-packaged décor and maybe a pine branch or two from your local coniferous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Try making your space look more festive with some traditional Christmas garnishes. Hang a stocking by the fire (or TV stand), throw up some mistletoe (for that special someone who walks through the door), and grab a couple of empty boxes to wrap and place beneath your tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: You can’t do traditional Christmas without a Christmas ham or turkey. For those looking for a vegetarian option, why not try a nut loaf as a savory alternative. For those who want to keep it simple, try one of the holiday feature meal kits from local restaurants like <a href=\"https://localpubliceatery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Local Public Eatery</a>. Pair your dinner with your favorite sides like mash potatoes, some greens, and a dinner roll (or two). Pick up a bottle of wine from <a href=\"https://www.ellementwine.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ellement</a> at the Forks. Wrap this meal up with some holiday sweets from local bakeries like <a href=\"https://tallgrassbakery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tall Grass Prairie</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xn--gtowpg-wta.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gato Bakeshop</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep friends and family entertained with an ugly sweater contest or a gingerbread house-building competition. You might just want to crack out a board game and play until the night runs dry. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7269\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tinsel and Tini</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to zhuzh things up this holiday season? Test out a Tinsel and Tini party that will give you a chance to crack out the sparkles and get a bit fancy. Think New Years&#8217; Eve at Christmas!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: While a classic pine is usually a go-to, an all-white tree will allow your Tinsel and Tinis party to shine. Dress it up with some silver and white decorations that shimmer like the snow on a sunny day. Pair this with a tinsel garland held together with a few logs of white birch and a couple of soy candles from <a href=\"https://www.coalandcanary.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Coal and Canary</a>. Tip: add in some hints of gold and pine green to tie this look together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: A Tinsel and Tini party is all about the Martinis. Test out your bartending skills with a few different options like this <a href=\"https://inspiredbycharm.com/white-christmas-martini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White Martini</a> from Inspired Charm or these <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/g2881/christmas-martinis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">holiday-inspired mixes</a> posted by Town &amp; Country. As for what to eat? Do dinner differently with a choose-your-own-adventure tapas bar. &nbsp;Keep it Christmas by throwing in some slices of turkey, a few dinner rolls, and some green and red olives. Top off the platter with some white chocolate bark or macaroons from <a href=\"https://www.caroonbymj.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caroon by MJ</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep this party focussed on the sips and dips by hosting a DIY martini bar! Throw in fondue and keep your guest full of laughs from mishaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7270\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nutcracker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s annual show, this theme allows you to tap into your artistic side and get busy with some DIY. Think sugar plum fairies, kingdoms and crowns, and a magic wand to bring it all to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: As with most of these themes, it starts with a tree, and this time, the bigger, the better. Dress your majestic coniferous in gold and wrap the base in crimson. Flank this tree with a couple of nutcracker soldiers, throw on some candy canes and add an angel on top. Hang those stockings and use a bit of extra fabric to create a luxurious garland for your “fireplace”. The key to this Christmas theme is decadence and extravagance. Make this party feel authentic by picking up a few antiques from <a href=\"https://www.thingsforrwb.com/?fbclid=IwAR0S4bGw8NmQXGkstmSPZXXLDCqKBrsirUodsSPo1lgxDmtvcWvomNqOR28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Things by RWB</a>. Remember to watch out for that Rat King though, he might try to steal all your goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Get into the theme by trying a few meat pies from local vendor <a href=\"http://www.mollysmeatpies.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Molly’s Meat Pies</a>. Pair these with some mushroom soup (my favorite is from <a href=\"https://earls.ca/locations/main-street/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Earl’s on Main Street</a>!) and a side of green beans. Grab a sip of your favorite vodka and try your hand at some homemade marzipan or sugar plums. Or you could just eat the candy canes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: What better way to get into character than by hosting a dress-up party? Have people come in their best nutcracker-inspired couture and dance the night away. You could even throw in a crown-making activity to see who really will be crowned the next Rat King!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7272\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>True North</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for something a bit more low-key? Why not think about an all-Canadian Christmas theme that screams cozy and cute with a little bit of camp? That’s right, we are talking about plaid wrapped in twine and drizzled in snowflakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Get that tree up and dress it in plaid and gold ribbons and bows. Feel free to paint the tips with a bit of white to make it look like it has just snowed. Those plaid stockings with the buck cut-out hung together with a few strings of twine would make a fine addition. If you want to get into the spirit, why not up the ante with a couple of hand-carved pieces from the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/qaumajuq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Winnipeg Art Gallery</a> in support of the new Qaumajuq gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Is it too much of a cliché to call on poutine, Bannock, and bacon, and beers? I don’t think so. Stay cozy and homey by serving up these Canadian favorites with a side of split pea soup. To end the evening, fire up the kettle and serve a round of hot toddies (maple syrup required) with a couple of butter tarts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Who can say no to a poutine station? Head down to the <a href=\"https://thecheesemongers.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cheesemongers Fromagerie</a> on Corydon and pick up some of your favorite poutine toppings. End this evening with a gift exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you choose to do, have a very happy holiday with your nearest and dearest!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can smell it in the air – the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season.

The dry air and fewer hours of light aren&#8217;t the best environments for most plants. However, some indoor household plants are best suited for even the chillier rooms. Check out the top 6 cold-tolerant plants that are sure to make your house cozier and brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Snake Plant</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plan1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7206\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Snake plant (Sansevieria) can resist low light, cool temperatures, and dry soil. This plant&#8217;s variety of colors and patterns will make your home more stylish, remove toxins, and improve air quality. For better care, during the winter, let these plants dry out between waterings</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geraniums</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7207\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Geraniums (Pelargonium) are cold-tolerant plants. The vibrant colors of its flowers will brighten your space and make it look like spring never left. Even though it is suited for chillier areas, it needs a few hours of daily sunshine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jade</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7208\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jade (Crassula Ovata) is known for gracefully tolerating winter and summer. This thick-leaves plant, like the Geranium, needs light to survive. Well-drained soil is essential for Jade, and you should consider watering it once every two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maidenhair Fern</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7209\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Need a plant that will thrive in a low-light environment? Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum) is your choice. This plant can survive with indirect light, but it&#8217;s essential to keep the soil humid, so it must be watered consistently and frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Succulents</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7210\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With many colors, patterns, and styles to choose from, succulents are probably the easiest indoor plants to take care of.  Succulents will survive dry, cold environments and are a good option if you like to leave your plants on your windowsill. You can create a succulent terrarium, mixing and matching the different styles of these incredible and resilient plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fiddle Leaf </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7211\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While certain plants grow during the winter, that is not the case with Fiddle Leaf (Ficus Lirata). Because of that, you need to adjust the watering for the cold season, reducing the plant&#8217;s watering to once every month if the room isn&#8217;t too humid. This plant likes consistent sunlight, so it is recommended to place it in a south-facing window.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For Winnipeggers, keeping the greenery in their homes throughout the cold months of winter can seem challenging.

You gotta love ‘em! Whether they’re fuzzy, feathery, or scaly, having animals makes a home happier. Mine recently became a three-cat household, and there’s always enough drama, excitement, and heartwarming cuteness to make every day an adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re thinking of adding a few paws, claws, or fins to your family, I urge you to consider making your adoption from one of the many local shelters and rescues. Providing a “furever” home for an animal in need will give you warm fuzzies inside <em>and </em>out &#8211; because pets are snuggly, <em>and</em> you’re supplying a loving environment to a creature who wouldn’t have one otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Before you adopt</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot to consider when choosing a pet. Before you get sucked in by all the adorable faces at your local rescue, assess your lifestyle and needs so you can find the “purrfect” pet for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to think about stuff like:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Space</strong> &#8211; your living space, specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do you rent or own?</strong> Check your leasing agreement to ensure a pet is allowed!</li><li><strong>Do you have room for activities?</strong> If you have a 500 square foot bachelor suite, a Great Dane probably isn’t for you.</li><li><strong>What about floor space?</strong> They’ll need a bed, bathroom, food, and toys. You’re making room for them in your life emotionally <em>and </em>physically.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finances</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Have you budgeted for ongoing costs?</strong> Your new pet needs food, litter, toys, treats, and regular vaccinations and check-ups even after the initial adoption fees. Make sure you’re OK to set aside some of your monthly scratches to take care of your pet.</li><li><strong>What about emergencies?</strong> If Fido swallows a priceless action figure or scarfs down the pan of brownies you left on the counter, you will need to make an emergency trip to the vet! These forays are usually <em>expensive</em>. Whether you stash away a chunk of that monthly pet budget into an emergency fund or have a spare credit card ready to go, make sure to have a plan in place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-1024x740.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7148\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-300x217.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-770x557.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-293x212.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-500x362.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498.jpg 1195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How often are you at home? </strong>Whether you’re home all day or gone in 10-hour stretches is a major factor in what kind of pet you should get. Training a new puppy requires constant vigilance, whereas a mature animal is better suited to spend time alone.</li><li><strong>How much time are you prepared to spend with them? </strong>All pets need quality time with their owners to establish and maintain a bond, just like any relationship. However, some animals are more independent, and others will hound you for attention. Assess how much time you can allocate to walking, grooming, feeding, playing, training, and petting, and adjust accordingly.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Energy level</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How active are you?</strong> Getting up to walk the dog in the morning is a good motivator, but it might also be something you regret committing to. Or, if you want a buddy to go with you on runs, somebody who wants to lie by the fire all day is not for you.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All animals require an investment of time and energy. What varies is how much. Even the most independent of animals need attention and care. So before you scurry off to the pound, take a moment’s “paws” to deliberate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adopt On!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re looking for a dog, cat, rabbit, guinea pig, or something more exotic, there are many local shelters you could choose to adopt from, such as D’Arcy’s Arc, Winnipeg Pet Rescue, Craig Street Cats, or the Winnipeg Humane Society.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7149\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Multiple visits <em>are</em> necessary</strong>. Chant this mantra to protect yourself against the impending cuteness. It’s hard not to come home with <em>all </em>the animals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shop around</strong> &#8211; don’t settle on the first pair of adorable eyes you see. When you do find an animal you connect with, you will know. When you find an animal you love, it’s ruff not to take them home immediately. But, a pet shouldn’t be an impulse decision. Many shelters will allow you to put a hold or deposit on the animal you’d like to adopt. Do this and sleep on the decision. If you still feel the same way in the morning, it might be time to take that chance. If you find yourself second-guessing, you may want to re-assess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Age and personality </strong>are much more relevant than an animal’s breed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider adopting an adult animal if you can. A new puppy or kitten is tempting, but they are a <em>lot </em>more work. Mature animals are more likely to be overlooked at shelters, but they’re often much more aware and grateful when they do get taken home. Plus, if they’re already potty trained, that’s a huge bonus!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get to know them by spending time with them at the shelter and talking with the staff who work with them daily to get a feel for the animal’s personality. Are they adventurous and playful? Social or stand-offish? How do they react to new people or interact with other animals? One isn’t necessarily better than the other, but think about what traits suit you best.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"7150\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369.jpg\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=7150\" class=\"wp-image-7150\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve decided on your new friend, bully for you! Be sure to get a full rundown of the <strong>health and history of the animal </strong>before signing the paperwork. Find out what shots they’ve had or still need, and if they’re already spayed or neutered, or if that’s something you need to arrange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you welcome them home, prepare a dedicated space in a separate room of your place so they can be introduced to the rest of the residents slowly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Homeward Bound!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>safe place </strong>is the first thing they need. New environments are scary for anyone! Of course, you’re eager to snuggle and play with your new roommate, but it’s important to remember it can take some time for your pet to adjust to its new home. Some agencies will even send along a blanket or something with a familiar scent that you can add to their setup for a bit of extra comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Establishing a routine</strong> is the best thing you can do to settle them in. The more they know what to expect on a day-to-day basis, the more comfortable they’ll be. Try to do things like feeding around the exact times every day. Keep going through the motions of a typical day, and eventually, they’ll begin to fall into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7151\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1.jpg 1555w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spending quality time with them</strong> during this initial settling-in stage is incredibly important. You’re trying to establish a new friend! Make sure to spend time talking to them, playing with them, and even just hanging out with them. If they’re shy or nervous, sitting quietly in the same space and doing something relaxed like reading a book or watching tv can help them get used to you being around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Treats </strong>are a great tool for enforcing good behaviors and easing separation anxiety. A treat when your pup lets you know he needs to pee or when the kitty tries out the designated scratching post will push their behavior in the right direction. And they’re not so worried when you leave if they get snacks when you do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have patience!</strong> Some animals will take to everything right away, while some may take a few days. My venerable Tiamat hates moving (who doesn’t!?) and will slink around warily for days until she knows every corner has been properly vetted. When we brought our newest one home, he was out galloping around with his new friend within the hour. Some animals may take weeks or even months to adjust fully, so be patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re “fur-tunate” enough to welcome an animal into your family, you will have made a “pawsitive” difference in both of your lives. You will always be the person who changed their lives for the better. And it’s such a joy to see them run to welcome you home, playing happily or sleeping comfortably in the sun. By choosing to rescue an animal, you free up space for the shelter to help more animals, <em>and</em> you give that animal a loving home. So hop to it and flock to your nearest rescue or shelter. Everybunny wins!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ah, pets! You gotta love ‘em! Whether they’re fuzzy, feathery, or scaly, having animals makes a home happier.

If you have been wondering if there is anything you can do with your dog this Halloween season, we have you covered. Check out this list of 7 pet-friendly ways to celebrate Halloween this year!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dog1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7091\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Trick-<em>and</em>-Treat</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trick and Treating is a tasty (for your dog anyway) and fun (for you both) way to kick of the Halloween season! They say that you can&#8217;t teach an old dog new tricks, but I beg to differ. It is never too late to teach any age dog, any trick! With a little bit of encouragement and the right motivation, they&#8217;ll have it in no time. Get into the spirit with your dog by trick-<em>and</em>-treat training. Look up some tasty treats (preferably that use up all that delicious excess pumpkin from your pumpkin carving), make your pet some haunted Halloween-themed treats, and teach them some spooky new tricks. There are many easy-to-make Halloween-themed dog treat recipes out there for you to make for your pup&#8217;s trick and treat training! There are many upsides to making your dog treats too. You know and control what is in them and the portion. Home-made treats are a healthier alternative to store-bought, especially when it comes to training sessions where your lucky dog is sure to reap consecutive treat rewards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you&#8217;re finding the perfect recipe, you can also find countless Halloween themed tricks out there you can teach your dog as well. Alternatively, it is just as easy for you to modify their favorites with a creepy spin. Try starting with easier tricks they might already know like &#8220;Find The Bones&#8221; (or any other Halloween-inspired command works). The idea is to hide a prop bone, hand, skeleton, whatever is going to work with your dog, and train them to go to it when you ask them to &#8220;Find the Bones.&#8221; Most dogs already know some version of &#8220;find me your or where is your toy&#8221; and will pick this up quickly. Another great set of tricks that is also really easy to teach and for your dog to learn is Play Dead &amp; Rise From The Dead. Playing dead is already an easy classic to teach your dog, or that you might have already. Try giving it a creepy spin by adding &#8220;Rise From the Dead&#8221; or &#8220;Resurrect&#8221; as a command for your dog to get back up, after playing dead! Your ol&#8217; dog&#8217;s new tricks are sure to surprise you, and your baking skills may pleasantly surprise you both. One thing to remember is if you are using new toys, decorations, props, and ingredients, make sure that they are safe for your pet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Do a Photoshoot!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is fun any time of the year, or day for that matter to take pictures of our pets, isn&#8217;t it? There is something fun and exciting in the holiday season about being able to dress you or your dog (or both) up in costumes, with no judgment from the internet. Take full advantage of doing a Halloween photoshoot with your dog! You will love the photos and the memories, and your dog is sure to love the outside playtime and extra attention! Pack your pup an adorable costume (again no judgment in two or three) and take them on an outdoor adventure to the perfect spot for your fall shoot! Once you find your set, try letting your dog explore and play in their costume while you take great action shots. But what&#8217;s better than a few cute pictures of your dog? Great photos of you and your dog, of course! Get in the spirit and join the photoshoot yourself and take some doggy-owner shots together. Try doing a matching or themed costume for added cute points on social media! Not sure of what to dress up as for your fall shoot? Try one of these classic human &amp; dog costume pairs like Cop &amp; Robber, Dorothy &amp; Todo, Shaggy &amp; Scooby, Charlie Brown &amp; Snoopy, just for some suggestions. Make sure you bring some of your Halloween treats as a reward and toys as encouragement for those criminally cute Halloween-themed shots!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dog2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7092\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Pup-kins</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t talk about celebrating Halloween without Pumpkins! Whether you&#8217;re putting them on your porch or in a pie, they&#8217;re fun to carve, bake, and even more, fun to pick yourself. There are many pet-friendly pumpkin picking patches. Pick the perfect pumpkins for all your decorating, carving, and baking needs alongside your favorite animal helper. You and your dog will love the time in nature, and your pet will love playing with and eating them. Challenge yourself by trying to carve one that looks just like your puppy for their very own pup-kin, a bonus that they make great Halloween decor for your pet party!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Have a pet costume party!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever wanted to be in a room full of dogs in costumes? Make that adorable fantasy an even cuter reality by getting you and your doggies BFFs (best furry friends) together for a fun Halloween pet party! Get the gang together in their favorite costumes for some scary good times! It&#8217;s a fun reason to get together and a great way for your dogs to get some socialization.

Get out for a fright night!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to leave your best friend at home to check out scary events and to have a haunted Halloween. And it certainly isn&#8217;t Halloween if you aren&#8217;t getting a good scare in! Many of Winnipeg&#8217;s favorite things to do like corn mazes, the zoo, pumpkin picking patches are pet friendly! Just make sure you check before you go, and make sure you know it&#8217;s not going to be too much for your pup. You want to be scared, not your dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Doggie Bobbing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds similar to the long-standing tradition of bobbing for apples right? You get buckets full of water, throw some apples in, and usually run a contest between a few people to see who can get them all out the fastest. Both harder than it looks and wildly entertaining to watch, it&#8217;s a time-tested favorite for a reason!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try giving this old favorite a cute twist by letting your puppy-pal try their paw at doggie bobbing! If you don&#8217;t want to use apples or you have a smaller dog, you can use tennis balls or pool toys. If it&#8217;s just you and your pooch, fill one bin or a bucket that is a good size for your dog with water, toss in some floating treats, toys, apples, and watch and be howling in laughter! If your dog doesn&#8217;t start bobbing for apples at the sight of the bucket- don&#8217;t panic. You may have to encourage your pup by showing them what to do and that it is there for them!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Trick-Or-Treat / Halloween Dog Walk</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but never least, celebrate Halloween the way it is intended to be celebrated, with actual trick-or-treating! Dress you and your dog up in amazing costumes, walk the neighborhood enjoying the costumes, decorations, and maybe trick-or-treating a little. If you don&#8217;t want to go real trick-or-treating you can check out pet-friendly places like pet stores, dog parks, and other puppy permitted places! You are sure to score some tasty treats for your dog (and not to mention candy for yourself) they will be expected to show off some of those spooky tricks so be ready!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is something about fall that brings Winnipeg to life more than any other season.

However, all of this re-portioning is finicky and I’m not about that life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, for my summer BBQs, I’m opting for things <em>already</em> personally portioned. There’s none of this going back to divvy things up, or repurposing upside down muffin tins to try to make parmesan cheese cups or something (which sound incredible!) Props to you if you want to go through that process, but that’s too tedious for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll lay out my top picks, so whatever you’ve volunteered (or been voluntold) to bring, you’ve got options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Salad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t want to bash salad too hard; there are many enjoyable salads &#8211; taco salad for instance. Also, potato salad, pasta salad, I love me a good corn and black bean salad. A bowl of lettuce and loosely chopped veggies though? I’m not into it. I digress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What <em>does</em> work for me?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-10 wp-block-gallery-9 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"732\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/saladroll.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6921\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/saladroll.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6921\" class=\"wp-image-6921\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll.png 732w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-300x221.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-293x216.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-500x369.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Salad Rolls</strong> &#8211; luscious rice paper wrapped delicacies filled with vermicelli, fresh herbs, pickled veggies and BBQ pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are a summer staple in my home. Be warned that if you opt to make them yourself, rice paper wraps are delicate and can be difficult to work with. They’re always tasty but often mine aren’t what you’d call <em>pretty</em>. You may want to try out a few before making a batch to present to the family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is home to some outstanding Vietnamese restaurants. Call ahead and order enough for the whole crew! Pick them up on your way over, and arrive at your party as a hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Sides</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, proteins are the star of the show, but what would they be without the support of some stellar side dishes? I suggest:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Devilled Eggs</strong> &#8211; If there was ever a time for the return of this devillishy delectable appetizer it’s now. Half a hard-boiled egg filled with creamy, seasoned yolk is a tantalizing, two bite snack. I’ll admit I’ve not made these myself. But, as someone who very much wants to eat these, I strongly encourage this choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that isn’t your style, how about&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers</strong> &#8211; These I <em>have</em> made, and they’re legendary (or maybe legen-DAIRY! Spoiler, they’re filled with cheese). To make these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Gut your jalapenos.<ol><li>I recommend wearing disposable gloves for this. Cut them in half and remove the pith (white bit) and seeds to reduce the worst of the heat.</li></ol><ol><li>If you’re really spice intolerant (like me) you can place the de-seeded peppers in boiling water for a few minutes to mellow them out.</li></ol></li><li>Fill them with a combination of your favorite cheeses.<ol><li>I recommend mixing shreds of a strong flavoured cheese like a smoked gouda or fresh parmesan up with some cream cheese, salt, and pepper for a scoopable cheesy filling.</li></ol></li><li>Wrap the filled jalapeno halves with a strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick.<ol><li>You still want it to be pliable enough to wrap, but I recommend partially cooking the bacon first to cut down on finishing time later.</li></ol></li><li>Bake in the oven or set on the grill until the bacon is fully cooked and voilà! You can’t go wrong with bacon and cheese.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have the time or the gumption for all that work, here are some simpler and just as appetizing appetizers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corn on the cob</strong> &#8211; This straightforward and classic BBQ staple is great on its own or can be jazzed up a ton of different ways. Try adding ingredients like lime juice and sweet chili sauce, or ranch and cheddar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-12 wp-block-gallery-11 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"980\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pineapple.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6923\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pineapple.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6923\" class=\"wp-image-6923\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple.png 980w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-500x333.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grilled Pineapple</strong> &#8211; Slice off rounds of this hearty fruit and throw them on the grill. When you take them off, finish with a sprinkle of cinnamon for a side that’s as delicious as it is easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mains</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect to see the regulars at BBQs this summer &#8211; hot dogs, burgers, steak, and chicken. But if you want to avoid the usual burger assembly with shared condiments and a pile of communal lettuce, may I suggest:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Stuffed Peppers </em></strong>&#8211; robust self-contained meals that need no accoutrement. Traditionally they’re filled with a mixture of ground beef, rice, and tomato sauce, then topped with cheese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t let that limit you though &#8211; you can pack these bad boys with whatever you want. I did a combination of pulled pork, mushrooms, and rice last week and they were <em>amazing!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key when grilling these is to make sure that the filling isn’t runny so it doesn’t all pour out when you tip it on its side. I recommend cooking these for a bit in a pan or on the cool side of the grill to soften the peppers, and then finishing them off over the flames for those ever-appealing grill lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Desserts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was so hard not to focus this whole thing on desserts. I recognize that people like to eat other things too, but why bother when you could just have dessert?!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a baker, cakes and pies can be scaled down to <strong>cupcakes or tarts</strong>. I really like the idea of having a whole (albeit tiny) pie all to myself! Everyone loves a cupcake, and I’ve got a foolproof recipe to please any crowd. For a ridiculously simple and customizable cupcake:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Take a box of white cake mix and ignoring the additional ingredients it calls for, combine it with any 355 ml can of soda you like to make the batter.</li><li>Then, dish the batter into your pans and bake according to the box instructions for a soft, fluffy, and soda flavored cake.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a batch of root beer float cupcakes this way and topped them with homemade swiss meringue buttercream frosting (which held up impeccably in the heat!). Don’t worry, a can of your favorite store bought frosting will work just as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For something a little lighter, Pinterest inspired an <strong>ice cream cone fruit salad </strong>which is (as you might expect) an ice cream cone filled with whatever fruits and berries you like. Top them with a little of <strong>Mama Dawn’s Famous Fruit Dip</strong>. It’s a quick recipe:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Take a 250 ml container of sour cream and stir in 2 tablespoons of brown sugar until completely combined.</li><li>Taste and add additional sugar if desired.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Downtown Winnipeg hosts a plethora of fantastic bakeries and confectionery shops where you can pick up a stunning contribution to the party with none of that extra effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is one more very important food category that has not been addressed yet:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"812\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kebab2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6924\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2.png 812w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Anything on a stick!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kebabs</strong> are the ultimate individual BBQ food, and if you can put it on a stick, it can be kebab’d. They’re perfect for an appetizer, main dish or even dessert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine sausage, steak, shrimp, or chicken with your favourite veggies &#8211; tomatoes, pineapple, onion, peppers, etc. &#8211; and you have yourself a killer kebab!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite combination has to be the Manitoba kebab, complete with Farmer sausage and mini perogies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For something more refreshing, try a kebab with watermelon and some cubed feta cheese. Or, you can load up some marshmallows and chocolate for a s’more stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get creative! When it comes to kebabs, the skewer’s the limit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps to inspire some great barbeque grub! With individual options for everyone, you can focus less on shared cutlery and more on shared conversations. Happy barbequing!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Barbecuing is already the quintessential summer activity.

It is not because such things as eating passion fruit gelato can be done in July particularly (after all, who would in a right mind choose that flavour during Christmas time?), but because choosing fruit flavours ice cream as well as eating on the patio makes sense in Winnipeg only during the hot season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons why Manitobans await summertime with such thirst and desire; one of them is anticipation of sitting on a patio with friends and family while sipping on craft cocktails. To add to the usual excitement of moments when patios start opening in the late spring, this season we also receive them with open arms because restaurants have been closed for an extended period. Today, we prepared a list of five famous downtown restaurants with available patio seating and the finest cuisines.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6916\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Forth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Forth bar, as customers say, is an absolutely beautiful bar with a marvellous patio. Truly, the place combines a coffee shop with a vivid hipster vibe on the main floor and a rooftop patio bar that overlooks Exchange District. In fact, the best time to visit the rooftop is right before the sunset hour. When golden sunlight touches downtown buildings, old and new alike, one no longer has a feeling that tomorrow is another workday; on the contrary, at the Forth rooftop bar, one feels like on a vacation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the food and drinks options, you can order such quick snacks as avocado toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, croissants, yogurt parfait and others, while the bar on the roof offers craft cocktails. As satisfied customers mentioned, you can tell the bartender about the flavours you like, and they will invent a cocktail just for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.forth.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.forth.ca/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cibo Waterfront Café</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cibo Waterfront offers a variety of Mediterranean-inspired foods like bruschetta, pizza, pasta and a selection of wines and beer. Customers confess that this restaurant is an enjoyable place for late-night food and drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while you might find quality pasta at many other places, the main attraction, in this case, is the location and the building itself. Like many other fashionable dining spots, Cibo locates in a former industrial building. (Pump and Screen House used to provide water coolant to Winnipeg’s Steam Heating Plant). The building still presents a high ceiling, massive windows, and brick walls: altogether, with a simple yet elegant interior, it creates a unique atmosphere. The patio has comfortably assembled tables and couches. At the moment, they, however, do not accept any reservation; instead, it is first-come, first-serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, across the road is the Mere Hotel. Thus, if you are a visitor in the city it might be a fine option for accommodation with a walking distance restaurant choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Browns Socialhouse Portage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers say Browns Socialhouse serves the best Caesar salad they have had in Winnipeg so far. Nevertheless, if you are not looking for the best salad in the city, but simply want a cozy patio with heaters, comfortable chairs, music, and city lights all around, this restaurant is worth checking out. Even though Browns Socialhouse belongs to a chain brand, according to many customers’ reviews it is one of the favourite places among locals. Some appreciate service; some enjoy a location that is right in the middle of downtown, and all of them, of course, agree that food is both tasty and comforting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu is enormous compared to other restaurants and offers a variety of cuisines. You can find sushi, soups, salads, fish and chips, burgers, pasta, famous bowls and tacos. And, to accompany all that food there is a broad menu of wines, beer, and cocktails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://brownssocialhouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">https://brownssocialhouse.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"835\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6917\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2.png 835w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>SMITH</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SMITH restaurant is located at the Forks, the area so loved by both locals and tourists. It is an upscale, modern, yet casual space with so much thought put into interior design and menu. The whole atmosphere of the restaurant, which is conveniently located inside the Inn at the Forks hotel, is finished in a unique combination of slick lines of wooden furniture, comfortable seating and virtuously prepared and served food. As for the patio, this year SMITH restaurant offers a new pop-up space in front of the hotel facing the Oodena Circle and Johnston Terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu is based on simple, yet freshest ingredients, and celebration of lands and water of the country: the focus is on cooking from locally produced and seasonal products of Canada. You can find such dishes as steaks, salads, grilled vegetables, burgers and more. Additionally, to accompany the fresh taste of ingredients, order some wine from Okanagan valley or craft cocktails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca/\">https://smithrestaurant.ca/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Peasant Cookery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Peasant Cookery is another local restaurant that deserves attention and a visit at least once a season for no other reason but to celebrate summertime. As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere of the 20th century overwhelms you, and the feeling that you are in the middle of a historic drama is inevitable. The restaurant is located right in the heart of Exchange District, and monumental buildings around and pleasant atmosphere in the restaurant create a unique dining experience. According to many satisfied customers, Peasant Cookery is the choice number one for anniversary celebration: dishes are simple and delicious, and the atmosphere is sophisticated yet down to earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu offers dishes cooked from fresh, locally sourced ingredients along with wines, local beers and craft cocktails. There are such pleasures as escargots, mussels, charcuterie boards, salmon, tarte flambé and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell us about your favourite patio in downtown Winnipeg and enjoy your summer cocktail!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://peasantcookery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">https://peasantcookery.ca/</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are certain activities we associate with summertime only.

We get lots of sunshine and there are plenty of things to do. Many people think of great summer adventures outside of our city, as we have wonderful parks and other outdoor spaces. But don’t be fooled. Downtown has its charms and attractions too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you are living in or visiting downtown Winnipeg on a fine summer’s day, where should you start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Forks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the obvious. The Forks is wonderful year-round. There is the fabulous indoor market. The Common now serves libations both indoors and out. You can pull up a Muskoka chair and sit around a fire in the evening, or you can walk along the riverfront. You can watch the boats go by, spy on the ducks and geese and even fish right off the Riverwalk. I’ve seen many a catfish pulled out of the water right by the docks. There are beautiful gardens and the Oodena to walk through. It takes an awful long time to get bored at the Forks, and it doesn’t cost you any money to wander around.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Forks-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6854\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-1024x576.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-770x433.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-293x165.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks.png 1329w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Parks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks isn’t the only pretty outdoor space downtown. Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park is tiny but lovely. You will find it at the corner of Main St. and Assiniboine. There is a small remnant of the fort, comfortable and original seating, and a lightshow every evening. If you bring your furry friend, you can cross Assiniboine and enter downtown’s Bonnycastle Dog Park. It’s nice to know not every part of downtown is a concrete jungle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downtown Winnipeg Farmer’s Market</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for fresh produce? You don’t need to leave downtown. During the warm months, you can trek over to the Downtown Winnipeg Farmer’s Market. Its current home is in True North Square. You will find it open every Thursday from 10am to 2:30pm, with all sorts of fresh produce sold from local farmers. You can also find baked goods, jams, honeys, cheese, crafts and other fun stuff. It’s wonderful being able to shop in the open air.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Yoga-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6855\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-1024x682.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fitness in the Park</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you overindulge in the baked goods at the market, you might consider joining Fitness in the Park for one of their many sessions. They offer free lunch classes every weekday. They use multiple locations, so this is also a nice way to get to know downtown Winnipeg’s green spaces. Currently, Fitness uses the Legislative grounds, Memorial Park, and the Millennium Library grounds for classes. Their main focuses are yoga and Morfit. It’s nice to get a midday break from being cooped up indoors and it’s a great way to keep fit. To learn more about the program, visit the Downtown Winnipeg Biz site. (<a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Exchange District</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the northeastern edge of downtown, The Exchange District beckons for visitors. You can sign up for one of their historic walking tours (<a href=\"http://www.exchangedistrict.org/historic-walking-tours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.exchangedistrict.org/historic-walking-tours/</a> ). Or you could just take yourself around. There are funky shops to visit and eateries aplenty, from poutine to fancy cuisine. Lose yourself on the winding streets and pretend you are visiting a city from a hundred years ago. The heritage buildings are delightful and a photographer’s dream. We are lucky that Winnipeg’s stalled economic progression from last century left us this beautiful legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Garden-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6856\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden.png 1296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gardens</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like flowers and pretty foliage? Who doesn’t? While you can see some lovely examples at the parks already mentioned, there are two other places downtown that are worth a visit. The Manitoba Legislature and surrounding buildings are lovely all year, but summer adds a pretty splash of colour. From the Leg, you can also walk down to the Riverwalk and enjoy the Assiniboine River.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the Leg, it’s a short walk to Dalnavert Museum on Carlton St. You may know it for its indoor tours of life in the 1800s, but the outdoor grounds are also worth a viewing. You can do a self-guided garden tour in the summertime. The gardens surround the house and are divided into six distinctive areas. Visit <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.friendsofdalnavert.ca</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Boat Tours</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you get sick of using your feet, you can head back to where you started, the Forks, for a river tour. Splash Dash is at it again this summer. You can book a ticket on their boats and cruise both the Assiniboine and Red, while learning a dash of history from your driver. Covid has changed their rules a little, but you can still book in with a group for a relaxing tour. Check them out at <a href=\"http://www.splashdash.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.splashdash.ca</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Material Future Summer Events</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we said seven, but let’s add an eighth reason to visit downtown — patios! Yep, downtown Winnipeg is chock full of them. Big ones, small ones, even rooftop ones. If you are looking for inspiration, check out the recent Patio Fest put on by Downtown Winnipeg Biz for location inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Patio-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6857\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1024x682.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio.png 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, while Covid still has many attractions closed, some will return later this summer and others will return next year. The Winnipeg Art Gallery, with its beautiful new Qaumajuq exhibit showcasing Inuit art, will likely be open by summer’s end, as will the Manitoba Museum. Once sporting events are back, it’s always a treat to take in a Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fish have an exceptional baseball park just across from the Forks. I don’t know about you, but I certainly miss stadium popcorn, hot dogs and drinks. Other events, like outdoor movies, might also return, making downtown an even more happening place. And if you live downtown, you don’t even need to worry about parking. That sounds rather ideal to me.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winnipeg in summer can be a glorious place.

I think it’s safe to say it’s not in most of ours. But it happens. Then suddenly, your life is in upheaval and your vision for the future needs to change. It’s stressful and kind of scary. And it sucks. But, it can also be an exciting opportunity to establish the new and improved, independent you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mondo checkbox on that to-do list is finding your new home. It’s a pretty daunting task. For most of us, being at home makes us feel comfortable and safe. If you don’t have that refuge to return to, or it’s full of reminders of your past life, well, it can make a tough time even harder. But it <em>is </em>possible, and even manageable. <em>You’ve got this.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that if I can do it, you can too. It won’t be easy, but you’ll be back on your feet in no time. Remember though, every situation is unique. Assess your circumstances and then tackle those hurdles as only you can!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you do anything else, you’ve got to answer this all important question:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s your budget?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A budget is <em>integral</em> to starting things off right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re going from living with a spouse and splitting the expenses to living on your own, you’re going to need to reassess your finances. Depending on your situation, this may drastically affect your standard of living (harsh, but true).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break down your monthly income and your current expenses. Which are non-negotiable? Which can be reduced? And when in doubt, round up! If you always count on socking away a little extra, the surplus will help to cover any unexpected expenses that crop up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a ballpark figure, about 30% of your monthly income is going toward rent. Depending on your earnings and your housing needs, that number might be even higher. In the quest for your new address, be sure to consider what utilities and amenities are included &#8211; a higher monthly payment might be worth it if it covers your electric bill and gym membership too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve run the numbers and you’re going to be hard pressed to make ends meet, <em>don’t panic</em>. There is social support in place for this situation you may qualify for. Those in Manitoba can find out more through the 2-1-1 phone line or website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know how much you’re prepared to spend, it’s time to hit the bricks (or the search engine).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6801\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-300x203.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-770x521.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-293x198.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-500x338.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1.jpg 1338w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding a place</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like with any important decision: take your time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another way of saying <strong>don’t take the first thing that comes along</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re eager to get out of this limbo and on with your life! But it’s worth it to look around and weigh your options (especially remembering some ‌places I considered &#8211; yikes!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do you want a place that fits your budget, you want something that fits your lifestyle. Somewhere you can reclaim that safe and comfortable environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short term, I recommend renting as opposed to buying for two main reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>&nbsp; &#8211; Right now your future is uncertain. A lease gives you the option to adjust your plans as circumstances evolve. Plus, it’s easier to find something that fits your budget.</li><li><strong>Convenience &#8211; </strong>You have enough to deal with without worrying about replacing appliances or building and yard maintenance! Instead, you can plunk yourself in a central location with easy access to whatever amenities you need.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>My downtown apartment was the perfect haven, with easy access to transit, restaurants, parks and entertainment. It had everything I needed to let me hunker down and put myself back together again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re searching the streets for vacancy signs, try not to worry about landing something&nbsp; before the month closes. If possible, shack up with a friend or even your Mom for a few weeks while you get your house in order (literally and figuratively). This gets you out of your old place into a transitory state. You’ll be more motivated to find a pad of your own <em>and</em> it gets you out of your old place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can check into short-term leases. If you need a place to recoup for a month or two before you sign a long-term lease, these can provide temporary asylum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The local Rental Guide, classifieds, internet searches and prowling the pavement are all great ways to get a beat on lucrative places for rent. Check them out and see what your options are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your new home is where you’re going to begin the next chapter of your life, it’s okay to take a bit of time to figure out something that fits you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ok, so you’ve found a place. Now what?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Out with the old in with the you!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things about divorce? Getting to choose your own aesthetic. Now’s your chance to design your space in a way that reflects <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purge the items that don’t fit anymore &#8211; both emotionally and physically. Throw the wedding pictures in storage, and swap that too big, memory ridden furniture for something that fits your space and your style. Whether you’re trawling department stores or thrift shops, it’s refreshing to pick out some new pieces you love.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Plan for Plants!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>People are happier with plants around. It’s almost like we do better with other living things nearby! (We do, that’s science.) I don’t pretend to understand <em>why </em>exactly having plants makes you feel better, but they reduce stress and improve your mood just by being there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not a plant person, you have options. Have you considered a spider plant? Even I managed not to kill that. Or, check out these out articles to find your fit:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/finding-your-houseplant-match/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Finding your houseplant match</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/which-plants-grow-best-in-your-apartment-making-your-apartment-greener/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Make your apartment greener</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Potentially pets</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6802\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-770x518.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-293x197.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-500x336.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s already you and your furry friend against the world, you’re set. But if not, you may want to take up cat-sitting, because like plants, we’re happier with animals around. You might even look into fostering or adopting a pet of your own!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caring for and having the company of animals can be rewarding and fulfilling. But think carefully before adopting a pet &#8211; it’s a big commitment. If your life is already in turmoil, heaping more responsibility onto your plate may not be the best idea. It adds extra complexity such as ensuring your new abode is pet friendly, and paying additional damage deposits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, having an animal around is super therapeutic because, well, they’re often cuddly and adorable. Plus the previously mentioned scientifically backed benefits of other living things! You’ve got options though &#8211; there are lots of programs in need of good foster homes for animals while they wait for adoption, or you can volunteer your time at the shelters themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, definitely crash your friend’s next trip to the dog park!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Get to know your neighbourhood</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re in a new place with all kinds of new things to discover! It can be a little intimidating, and you may still be mourning the loss of your favorite coffee shop, but getting out and about in your neighbourhood has multiple benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, it’s important that you actually get up and leave your place occasionally, even if you don’t want to. Being outside is <em>another </em>of those scientifically backed well-being things. Plus, how else are you going to find the local restaurant with the best patio?? (Besides on the internet &#8211; you need to go check it out!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting familiar with your new surroundings is a <em>huge</em> step toward quelling that out-of-place feeling. You’ll start recognizing the local baristas and it will ‌become more and more like home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remember: Everything is going to be OK</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6803\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-500x375.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It might take a while, but over time things will begin to feel normal again. In the meantime, it’s okay <em>not </em>to be okay. Lean on your friends and family, talk to a therapist, dispose of that pair of your ex’s underwear you found, preferably in a needlessly spectacular and ruthless fashion. Do what you need to do to get through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divorce is cruddy, but it’s also the start of something new. Things won’t ever be the same, but there are plenty of reasons you don’t want them to be. By taking the time to prepare and find a place that provides what you need, you’ll have a new home base and foundation off which to launch. Having the comfort of a home that embodies <em>you</em> will provide the safety and structure you need to heal and start the next leg of your journey.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, divorce wasn’t exactly in your life plan.

Goodbye winter jackets and hello spring dresses. Who doesn’t love the smell of freshly cut grass in the air? The sight of colorful flowers finally popping up in the soil?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is one of the most awaited seasons for most of us in Winnipeg. Winters are too cold and summers can sometimes be too hot. With limited mobility though, some of us might not feel as excited to greet the season as others normally do. But have no fear! There is still a lot to do in the city! And downtown has some attractive places to offer!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, look at that sun shining. And a quick check at the weather app confirms it is 20 degrees. A warm day means it’s the perfect time to try out some new ice cream flavors. <a href=\"https://www.feteicecreamcoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fête on Assiniboine Avenue</a> is a cute little ice cream shop that boasts of not only great ice cream, but amazing coffee, cakes and waffle crisps (I didn’t know this was a thing, but it is! And this taste delicious with ice cream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus? You can take a stroll in the park next door as you enjoy your favorite flavor of ice cream. Bonnycastle Park also has a little dog park in the vicinity, so it’s a great spot to go to for you and your furry pal to enjoy a sweet treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png\" alt=\"Dog Running in the field\" class=\"wp-image-6739\" width=\"761\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png 655w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-293x165.png 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another favorite ice cream spot is <a href=\"https://chaebanicecream.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chaeban on Osbsorne</a>. They have some amazing flavors with very wholesome ingredients. I kid you not, I could taste real mint leaves in their mint ice cream. Their outdoor sitting area offers the perfect opportunity to enjoy a relaxed evening outdoors just enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown while having a heavenly treat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sough after landmark to enjoy the season is the Forks Market. You can pop inside the market to check out stores that offer unique handmade items or simply roam around the Commons to grab a drink and enjoy the sun. The area also offers a scenic view and a track along the river where you can bike or jog to soak up some sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if you enjoy history there are some great monuments to see. And if you’re more into modern art, they’ve recently set up the ‘Forever Bicycles’ monument along with other art pieces to view. If you have little kids to entertain alongside, they have great play structures and a splash pad to cool off after all the walking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking alongside the Riverwalk at <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Forks </a>can take you to another landmark in downtown, the Legislative Building. With its extensive gardens and fountain, you can not only get a scenic view to enjoy a cup of coffee, but also admire the structure of the Legislative Building itself with the golden boy shining in all his glory. It makes for a lovely backdrop for some great pictures, especially during sunset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg also offers an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visit the Exchange District</a>, very close to the intersection of Portage and Main, one of the most popular intersections in all of Canada. The Exchange District has heritage buildings so if you’re looking for a sneak peek into the city’s past, it’s the perfect twenty blocks for a stroll. You can expect to see restaurants, theatres and the Old Market Square with its quaint backdrop. &nbsp;Each structure has a story to tell, if we only have the time to listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not a history or art buff like me, and prefer instead to be surrounded by nature, maybe listening to some water flowing or birds chirping then I have a great spot for you. But where will you find a spot like that in downtown amidst all the hustle and bustle of Main Street? Not too far I promise. In fact, it’s in our very own downtown.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-14 wp-block-gallery-13 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6741\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6741\" class=\"wp-image-6741\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the idea of sitting on a picnic blanket and sipping some lemonade sounds appealing to you then look no further, and I mean literally! I recently discovered this cute little park called Happyland Park right here in downtown. It has an amazing view of the river, rolling green hills and a great play area for the kids. There are sitting areas made if you aren’t the picnic blanket sort and the open green space is a real treat for the eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also check out <a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/information/discovering-ufg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park on Main Street</a>. It not only has light and sound shows but sometimes, you might be able to spot yoga enthusiasts practicing. Feel free to join in if you’re looking for an opportunity to unwind!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring in Winnipeg is like a finicky hotel guest, looking for a reason to check out. So let’s try to make the most out of this season. Use it to explore downtown, take long walks, eat lots of ice cream and smell that fresh grass every chance you get!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liked the article? <a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/its-ice-cream-time-a-guide-to-downtown-winnipeg-ice-cream-shops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here and check our definitive guide to Ice Cream shops in Downtown!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finally!

Plus, we’ve got breakfast and lunch to contend with as well, now that we’re spending more time at home than ever.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are still plenty of takeout and delivery options in Winnipeg, home cooking is less expensive and &#8211; usually &#8211; a healthier choice (plus, the less contact with other people the better!). But&nbsp;<em>what are you making??</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing for three meals a day, seven days a week &#8211; plus snacks! Don’t forget the snacks! &#8211;&nbsp; can be pretty daunting, but meal planning isn’t about picking out 12 new recipes you’ve never tried before and forcing them into your week. It’s about forming your food schedule around your lifestyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think that meal planning is only for busy soccer moms, but regardless of whether you’ve got a family at home or it’s just you and your<em>&nbsp;tchotchkes</em>, a little prep can save you time, money, and more importantly, the anguish of having to choose what’s for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do a lot of cooking to support my eating habit and I’ve picked up a few strategies over the years. Here are my tips for creating a manageable meal plan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/First-picC-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Woman cooking dinner\" class=\"wp-image-6623\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>1 &#8211; <strong>Plan around your schedule.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re thinking about meals for the upcoming week, consider what else you’ve got going on and how they will affect your time and energy for food prep.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slotting in a crock-pot recipe if you’ll be at the (home) gym late, or you’re planning that Zoom cocktail get-together with your friends, lets you quickly throw together a completed meal.&nbsp;Or, when the whole evening is wide open, that’s the perfect opportunity for something more elaborate you’ve been wanting to try!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to keep in mind (as if we could forget) &#8211; Mondays are hard. Whatever day your Monday actually is, plan for something delicious and relatively easy (think pasta night with salad for lunch). A quick win at the beginning of your week starts you off on the right foot and makes the rest of the week seem easier!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Basic ingredients\" class=\"wp-image-6625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2 &#8211; <strong>Consider what’s in your refrigerator.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If those bell peppers are on their last legs or your milk is about to expire, pick recipes that will use them up!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try writing a master ingredient list for everything you want to make in the coming week. Before you go to the store, go through your fridge, freezer, cupboards, secret food stash in the ceiling and mark off all the things you already have &#8211; Ta-da! Whatever is left is your grocery list!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3 &#8211; <strong>Build your basics.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-stocked pantry is the key to successful home cooking. These are your building blocks for many recipes and are enough on their own to throw together a Plan B meal in a pinch. At minimum, I’m talking about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Salt &amp; pepper&nbsp;</li><li>Olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>Soup stock (chicken or veggie are the most versatile),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Rice&nbsp;</li><li>Pasta&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;vinegar&nbsp; (mine is balsamic but if you’re only going to pick one, white wine vinegar is my recommendation&nbsp; &#8211; it’s mild, gives the acidity you want and gives a little wine-y&nbsp;flavor&nbsp;to your recipes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>And don’t forget a sweetener &#8211; honey, agave or even maple syrup!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other good things to keep around are: garlic, ginger, onions, beans (canned for spontaneous beans or dried if you’re really planning ahead), canned tomatoes and some canned soups. There are so many things you can do with a can of mushroom soup! I’ll share my recipe for mushroom “Alfredo” sauce below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you get an idea of what your go-to recipes take, you’ll know what else you want to keep on hand. You probably want a selection of your&nbsp;cherished&nbsp;condiments and sauces &#8211; ever since I discovered <em>Hoisin</em> sauce, there is never not some in my fridge!&nbsp;And it never hurts to keep an emergency box of KD around,&nbsp;<em>just&nbsp;</em>in case!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"820\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg\" alt=\"Food portioned to be frozen\" class=\"wp-image-6626\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-300x240.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-770x616.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-293x234.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-500x400.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers.jpg 1207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4 &#8211; <strong>Anticipate leftovers.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love leftovers! Not only do I get more of the delicious things I already made, but I also get to skip cooking something else. If I make up a big batch of meatballs, that’s three or four meals worth of protein that I can either eat with leftover rice, throw in with other ingredients, or if I don’t want to eat the same thing all week, freeze for later.&nbsp; Which reminds me of&#8230;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5 &#8211; <strong>Batch cook meals to freeze (so when you don’t want to cook, you don’t have to!).&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re cooking up big meals, why not go the extra kilometer and make some things that are freezer friendly? This can be leftovers (if your recipe freezes well), a batch of freezer burritos (don’t worry, I’ve got a recipe for you) or breakfast muffins (regular muffins, or egg “muffins”, or even donut muffins. I couldn’t choose my&nbsp;favorite, but there are many recipes online).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part &#8211; if you spend a little time creating these freezer meals, you have several options to grab, nuke, and go for those days when you don’t have the time or energy to get in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Man holding plate of tacos\" class=\"wp-image-6627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1400x935.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day.jpg 2022w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>6 &#8211; <strong>Try a Theme Day!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For an easy jumping off point in your meal planning, slot in a Theme Day (the term for this is actually Meal Templates, but that is not as fun as a Theme Day).&nbsp;We always think of Taco Tuesday, but you could do Mexican Monday or Curry Thursday. Your Theme can be whatever you like &#8211; it doesn’t even have to start with the same letter as the day! Pick a couple of categories you like and plan on them once a week. Fun!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of focal point is helpful when you’re meal planning. You’re basically narrowing down the field from&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>the recipes to a specific category of recipes to choose from. If you know that you’re having pasta on Friday you only need to decide whether you’re making that decadent carbonara or a lasagna that could feed you through the weekend (or freezes really well).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7- <strong>Rely on your tried-and-true recipes.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our go-to meals, the ones we keep coming back to again and again. Well, they’re&nbsp;popular&nbsp;for a reason! It’s not necessary to get a roster of brand-new recipes every week. On nights when you’re busy with other things or you just want something easy or familiar, rely on those recipes that you know will not fail you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My current easy, throw-together meal is a cucumber and tomato salad (and yes, you can have this recipe too). It’s super versatile and as simple as chopping up some veg, throwing that into a bowl and eating!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8 &#8211; <strong>Try new things.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the internet, we no longer need to rely on our mothers’ hand-me-down cookbook for recipes (though do keep that close by). It’s easy to search for a recipe for almost anything and find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even websites where you plug in the ingredients you want to use, and it will return a list of options for you! (Reverse lookup for recipes? Yes, please!). Personally, I’m a big fan of All Recipes where people share their own recipes and others can review them. You can see pictures, read about how it turned out, and what you might want to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One sneaky little trick (a&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;of my mother’s) is to regularly patrol the send-you-meal-ingredients-in-a-box service websites. There is often a cache of recipes that rotates with what they’re currently offering. You can snag those tasty recipes and then buy your own ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9Prep-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Chopped vegetables on the board\" class=\"wp-image-6628\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>9 &#8211; <strong>Prep ingredients in advance.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of knowing what you’ll be making is figuring out what ingredients you need ahead of time. This makes it easy to chop up a bunch of vegetables whenever you have a spare 10 minutes, and have them ready to go. If you can’t imagine where you’d get a spare 10 minutes, set aside a dedicated half hour at some point in the week instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all your onions, peppers and garlic are already chopped, you can throw them straight into the pan without worrying about the prep work. Trust me, you’ll thank your past self for your forethought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So&#8230;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meal planning seems like a lot of work. And don’t get me wrong, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;still work. But the amount of time you put into it easily pays itself back and then some when you no longer need to waffle (mmm… waffles) over what you are going to make for breakfast, lunch and dinner each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking is creative &#8211; have fun with it! I like to use versatile recipes that can be catered to my own tastes. Don’t be afraid to experiment &#8211; adjust the seasonings to your preference. If you hate bell peppers but love carrots, swap them out. Not all your experiments will turn out to be amazing, but some of them will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve got a few recipes to get you started. These are my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;versions of these recipes, and I can tell you that&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;love them, but make your own adjustments as you see fit. Have fun!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Mushroom Alfredo\" class=\"wp-image-6629\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo.jpg 1524w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Mushroom “Alfredo” &#8211;&nbsp; 4 servings</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly traditional, but tasty and with less fat than a true Alfredo&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2 teaspoons olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>1 small yellow onion, chopped&nbsp;</li><li>2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped (this is being conservative, but you measure garlic with your heart)&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)&nbsp;</li><li>1 can of condensed mushroom soup&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup (about 1 soup can full) half &amp; half cream&nbsp;</li><li>½ cup grated parmesan cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Fettuccine noodles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Parsley&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Directions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet.

Here are three reasons why I think it’s important and healthy for young people to move out of their parents’ home and start living on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 1:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Show your family—and yourself—that you’re ready to be more mature&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-chores-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6542\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re moving out for freedom, room to grow, or just a more convenient location, living on your own requires some life skills and emotional maturity. Living on your own, you learn to rely on yourself to overcome challenges. You’ll learn how&nbsp;to manage finances, space, time, and, most importantly, how to deal with unpleasant situations.&nbsp;These are some of the&nbsp;best teachers out there to teach&nbsp;a young person maturity and independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I moved out for college, the first few days were full of delightful hours of organizing my place and thinking about all the fun I could have living on my own. Then came the realization that it wasn’t all going to be fun, and I had a lot of new things to learn: new lessons&nbsp;that&nbsp;I am grateful for, but&nbsp;were not what I expected.&nbsp;I can’t count how many times I thought about giving it all up and moving back in with my parents.&nbsp;However, times of&nbsp;instability turned&nbsp;me into a&nbsp;more&nbsp;mature person and allowed me&nbsp;to see myself in a new light, which wouldn’t have happened in&nbsp;the comfort of my parents&#8217; house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 2:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Give yourself the freedom you need to grow&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"707\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-freedom-1024x707.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6543\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-300x207.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-770x532.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1536x1061.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-2048x1414.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-293x202.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1400x967.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-500x345.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, we all need more&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;and freedom of choice than we can usually find living with our parents.&nbsp;No matter how loving&nbsp;and understanding your&nbsp;parents are,&nbsp;one day&nbsp;a bedroom starts feeling too tight&nbsp;and you start to crave a bigger, more private space.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;not&nbsp;just&nbsp;about the square footage;&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;about the ability to&nbsp;cook&nbsp;and watch&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;you want,&nbsp;and to invite&nbsp;over&nbsp;whoever&nbsp;you want, whenever you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I had to learn some harsh lessons along the way,&nbsp;living on my own expanded my creative ideas in terms of interior design, and my social skills when it came to hosting my parties. After years of living and studying under my parents’&nbsp;intent&nbsp;gaze, moving out allowed me to live as I wanted without interrupting the plans of others.&nbsp;I had the space I needed to find my self—and to have yogurt for dinner if I wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 3:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Learn responsibility&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6544\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Living on your own teaches responsibility like nothing else!&nbsp;Parents tend to see&nbsp;their children as little kids&nbsp;who require constant protection,&nbsp;no matter what age they already are. They just can’t help but&nbsp;protect and take as much care as they can to provide a comfortable and carefree&nbsp;life for their kids.&nbsp;Home-cooked meals together,&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean house, set schedule,&nbsp;and no need to think about&nbsp;finances&nbsp;are wonderful for a child, but eventually that child becomes a young adult who needs to live on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving out and dealing with all of these things on your own is like a crash-course in responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My whole&nbsp;being&nbsp;disagreed with the fact that mama was&nbsp;no longer near, and she would not take care of me waking up on time and having a healthy breakfast. The first few months&nbsp;of living on my own&nbsp;were like&nbsp;a nightmare where chores fell on my head with no warning.&nbsp;Eventually, I learned it all and developed new habits. A&nbsp;clean house,&nbsp;reasonable wake-up time, finished homework, and my full stomach were consequences of responsible actions I had to take on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By living on my own,&nbsp;I learned essential things that I would&nbsp;never have learned living with my parents.&nbsp;It made me more responsible, more mature, and allowed me to understand myself better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now, tell us your story of leaving the nest or living on your own for the first time!

The year of slow search not only helped me to save money&nbsp;by avoiding&nbsp;impulsive purchases, it&nbsp;also showed&nbsp;me&nbsp;how&nbsp;to avoid&nbsp;these&nbsp;hasty decorating disasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"948\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-tips-948x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6523\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-948x1024.jpg 948w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-278x300.jpg 278w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-770x832.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-293x317.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-500x540.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 948px) 100vw, 948px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 1</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Not doing your research</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first year of my independent lifestyle,&nbsp;my furniture consisted of a&nbsp;desk&nbsp;(which doubled as a&nbsp;dining table)&nbsp;and a queen-size bed. The rest of my apartment&nbsp;was light on&nbsp;décor and&nbsp;heavy on&nbsp;notebooks and papers. However,&nbsp;a&nbsp;year of dreaming&nbsp;about decorating&nbsp;as soon as my bank account would&nbsp;allow,&nbsp;made me focus on&nbsp;identifying the&nbsp;colours, shapes and styles&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wanted around&nbsp;me. That research, inspiration boards and constant visits to vintage shops&nbsp;helped me form a clear picture&nbsp;of what pieces I needed. I focused on mid-century inspired furniture, minimal artwork, and a&nbsp;palette of grey, blue and yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;surrounded by millions of choices. Online shopping&nbsp;means we can order&nbsp;a coffee table with two clicks.&nbsp;Or we can drive to the nearest big-box store and pick out a couch on the spot. But even with&nbsp;a plethora of choices,&nbsp;it can be hard to find just the right item to make your space feel complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mistake of not&nbsp;doing your research&nbsp;means you’re not&nbsp;defining&nbsp;your&nbsp;style and&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;colour palette. Without a precise idea&nbsp;of what you’re looking for,&nbsp;shopping trips&nbsp;quickly spiral into&nbsp;confusion and irritation.&nbsp;On the other hand, a clear picture of what you want&nbsp;will make&nbsp;every&nbsp;store visit&nbsp;easier—even if it takes you a while to find what you’re looking for.&nbsp;Instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;making&nbsp;impulsive purchases as soon as you move in,&nbsp;focus on studying the space, picking&nbsp;your&nbsp;favourite colours, planning the amount of furniture, and imagining&nbsp;the final look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6522\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-300x264.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-770x678.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1536x1353.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-293x258.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1400x1233.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-500x441.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research.jpg 1832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick research tips</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use Pinterest to create virtual inspiration boards and save your ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Browse&nbsp;interior design magazines like Vogue Living, ELLE Decoration, House &amp; Garden,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Style at Home&nbsp;(check the library for free copies, but no cutting out photos!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Take your inspiration from cinematography!&nbsp;Pick the era or style you want to reflect in your place and gather ideas from movies&nbsp;set in&nbsp;that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A&nbsp;stroll&nbsp;through the park, evening at the lake,&nbsp;or walk in the snow&nbsp;can not only&nbsp;give you&nbsp;ideas,&nbsp;but&nbsp;also be a great photography inspiration for DIY décor!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 2:&nbsp;Buying everything at once&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband is a wise man: he held&nbsp;my hand&nbsp;to keep it away from my&nbsp;credit card every time I was close to&nbsp;making an&nbsp;impulsive&nbsp;purchase. He&nbsp;would ask, “Would this item&nbsp;bring&nbsp;you&nbsp;the same joy&nbsp;a few years from now?”&nbsp;When I did eventually make purchases,&nbsp;I found myself fully satisfied with&nbsp;my choices.&nbsp;Plus,&nbsp;I really enjoyed&nbsp;looking around&nbsp;and&nbsp;taking&nbsp;the time to explore&nbsp;unknown&nbsp;shops&nbsp;to finally find that one unique item.&nbsp;(I’m&nbsp;also&nbsp;happy with my&nbsp;husband for&nbsp;talking me out of buying things spontaneously&nbsp;without&nbsp;a second thought!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-buy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6521\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furniture, especially essential pieces we use every day, is not&nbsp;something we can&nbsp;easily&nbsp;donate&nbsp;whenever you want to try something new. A dining table is not a sweater that&nbsp;can&nbsp;be worn twice and then passed&nbsp;on&nbsp;to someone else.&nbsp;The furniture we bring into our homes is usually with us a long time, so we should&nbsp;surround ourselves with&nbsp;things&nbsp;we genuinely enjoy looking at and using day after day.&nbsp;The consumer mentality is also changing. Minimalism and mindful purchasing&nbsp;are&nbsp;more than just trendy; they’re&nbsp;a helpful way to create less clutter and&nbsp;do less harm to the&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve done the hard work of defining your design concept and choosing colours,&nbsp;the&nbsp;next&nbsp;mistake to avoid would be buying it all at once. There is no worse feeling than the regret of the&nbsp;poor&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;you no longer like after just a few months.&nbsp;You walk around that no-longer-beautiful&nbsp;coffee table, blaming yourself&nbsp;for not searching longer because&nbsp;just yesterday&nbsp;you saw&nbsp;the coffee table of your dreams—too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hunt is the most exciting part of interior design!&nbsp;Sorting through&nbsp;local flea markets,&nbsp;exploring furniture stores&nbsp;other than The&nbsp;Brick and Ikea, looking for artisan-made pieces,&nbsp;not stopping until you’ve found the perfect piece… It’s fun and satisfying and will pay off for years to come!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 3: </strong><strong>Choosing</strong><strong>&nbsp;only trendy pieces</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trends surround us for&nbsp;specific reasons. Companies follow fashion trends to sell more. People follow them to stay&nbsp;fashionable&nbsp;and&nbsp;project a certain image.&nbsp;Not every trend&nbsp;is&nbsp;worth following, though. Many trends won’t reflect&nbsp;your&nbsp;personal taste, and&nbsp;some trends don’t last very long.&nbsp;The same way leather leggings&nbsp;won’t always be popular,&nbsp;distinctly uncomfortable furniture trends will fade after a few seasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember&nbsp;the year of the&nbsp;ubiquitous obsession with golden pineapples.&nbsp;Pineapples were everywhere:&nbsp;on pillows, candles, cups, and even on bigger pieces of furniture.&nbsp;Pineapples were all over&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;on every shelf and every t-shirt. However, the trend faded rapidly&nbsp;because&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;real meaning behind it. (Don’t&nbsp;get me wrong: pineapple is delicious!). The&nbsp;poor&nbsp;pineapple&nbsp;is a great example of&nbsp;those trends that&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;becomes monotonous and gets thrown away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"974\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6520\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg 974w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-285x300.jpg 285w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-770x810.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1460x1536.jpg 1460w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-293x308.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1400x1473.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-500x526.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple.jpg 1755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, you’ll find a lot more&nbsp;pleasure in simple lines, quality materials, and classic designs. Trends&nbsp;can be fun to play with when adjusted for your&nbsp;personal style,&nbsp;but they’re better suited to&nbsp;small pieces such as&nbsp;pictures, candles, cups,&nbsp;and pillows. Those pieces are&nbsp;easier&nbsp;to replace when you’re&nbsp;tired of the trend or want to refresh it for another season. When searching&nbsp;for&nbsp;basic, important&nbsp;pieces of furniture, stay closer to minimal design and timeless forms&nbsp;to avoid long-term regret.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake 4: Picking&nbsp;the cheapest pieces&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, a&nbsp;carefully thought-out&nbsp;budget&nbsp;will save you&nbsp;money and allow you to purchase higher-quality pieces. Cheap, mass-produced&nbsp;furniture&nbsp;is like&nbsp;fast-fashion clothing.&nbsp;Cheap garments,&nbsp;and&nbsp;cheap furniture, are not made&nbsp;to last long. Brands&nbsp;hope for your return after the chair&nbsp;breaks in a year or two or&nbsp;the&nbsp;jeans rip after six months.&nbsp;They&nbsp;give up&nbsp;quality&nbsp;in favour of the&nbsp;cheapest-possible materials&nbsp;in mass production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until&nbsp;consumer habits change, cheap furniture and poor-quality clothing will&nbsp;stick around. As soon as we, as consumers, understand that higher-quality wood and fabric require more money, and better-made pieces require more time and effort,&nbsp;we can see the value in buying quality.&nbsp;Quality furniture,&nbsp;made to last,&nbsp;might&nbsp;seem more expensive than mass-produced housewares. But&nbsp;by&nbsp;buying a better-quality piece, you’re&nbsp;investing&nbsp;in the number of years&nbsp;the item will last without needing repair or replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6519\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your&nbsp;couch wears out after a year of sitting on it, you&nbsp;might buy another&nbsp;low-quality one.

As soon as the quarantine started, I no longer had that excuse. After spending the first week of quarantine feeling completely overwhelmed and eating too many unhealthy snacks, I browsed YouTube for exercise videos to help me feel healthy and energetic. That’s when I discovered online barre workouts. Since starting barre, I really enjoy spending time early each morning doing barre’s combination of cardio, stretching, and ballet movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve also always wanted to learn about literature and art, but never felt like I had the time due to work, family, and life in general. Fortunately, in the age of the internet, access to free quality courses from major universities—including Harvard!—is unlimited, and that is where I found myself. As soon as I discovered a few classes open to the public, I was showing up for online lectures every day to study Goethe, the Odyssey, world literature, Impressionism, and Renaissance paintings.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6431\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2.jpg 1840w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps learning about some of the most significant art ever created inspired me to return to painting. When the pressure of devastating news about the virus expanded, and anxiety touched us all, I pulled my brushes and canvas out of the basement. They say to paint flowers when you’re anxious, and that’s what I did. The stress lessened. Painting fruits and flowers brought me back to studying in art school as a child. Those happy times somehow returned with every brush stroke. The first day I pulled out my painting essentials, I drew for hours. It calmed me, giving me hope and inspiring me to create more, whether it was more pictures or writing pieces. While I was occupied with studying, exercising, painting, four weeks of quarantine passed by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time moved as quickly as before the quarantine, but I didn’t waste time complaining. Instead, I got back to the joy that exercising daily, studying literature, and painting bring me, and these activities had a huge impact on my mental and physical health. It’s common sense that your body needs physical activity, and your mind needs learning. But caught between chores and obligations in a busy world, we often forget the impact these basic practices can have. I know I forget quite often!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the quarantine was devasting in many ways, I was able to find a routine of pleasures that restored me. In taking as much time as I wished for exercising, writing, and studying, I found reconciliation with part of myself I had forgotten exists. It was as if with the world falling apart, my little nest of delightful activities was building up. But don’t get me wrong: I can’t wait for the end of this global pandemic and the pain it has brought for so many. I can’t wait for the simple ability to travel or spend an hour in a coffee shop—little things that we used to take for granted. But there was something marvellous in living like a lady from a novel, who spends her days in a garden reading or at her easel painting flowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6433\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The unexpected quarantine interrupted a lot of plans and changed the routines of many people.

As the introvertiest of introverts, spending time at home is something I relish, but if you’re the type who likes to be on the go, you probably feel like you’re grounded and it </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">wasn’t even your fault</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">! Lucky for you, being sent to my room was always my punishment of choice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you’re stuck at home, here is my guide on how to cope in confinement:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 1: Take a deep breath</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The first thing to remember is that you’re at home, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">so </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">relax! Easier said than done, I know. When you have places to go and people to see, you’re usually on a clearly</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8211;</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">defined schedule. Since you’re </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">staying </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">home </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">right </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">now, take a deep breath and slow down: sleep in longer than usual, stay up late watching that critically</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8211;</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">acclaimed movie, prepare that delicious but oh-so-time-consuming recipe. Whatever it is, take your time.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Which brings me to Step 2. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Appreciate the little things</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Reacquaint yourself with how your favourite chair is comfortable in just the right way and luxuriate in the smell of your coffee. Sometimes when we’re surrounded by the same things every day, we </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">can’t help but </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">take them for granted</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Take </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a moment to reflect on life’s little joys and you’ll be happier for it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 3: Create structure</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To keep time from mushing together, it’s crucial to maintain at least some semblance of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">routine.

There are also the </span><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.ca/product/levolor-decorative-roller-shades/1000113182\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">pull-down roller types</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> or roman blinds if you want to use </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">that fabric you have your eye on, but you might need to get them custom made.</span></p>\n<h3>2. How much work are you willing to put into installing them?</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Blinds contain mechanisms for opening and closing, making them immediately more com</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">plicated. Keep in mind that you’re either going to be mounting them to the inside of the window frame or the wall itself! This means </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">you’ll </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">need to drill directly into something, and be precise with your measurements </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">for </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">inset blinds.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you’re co</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ncerned about damaging the walls, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">heavy-duty </span><a href=\"https://www.walmart.ca/en/command/N-1020336\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Command hooks</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> are usually capable of supporting a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">curtain rod </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">(as long as you’re not hanging those weighty antique velvet drapes). Plus, you’re </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">dealing with just the one rod, so it’s not as complex.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here’s a</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">neat trick I came across</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">: W</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">hen you’re marking the spots for the support mounts, if you position an L-shaped piece of cardboard against the window frame and push a pencil through, you can flip it around to mark the opposite mounting point evenly. (So simpl</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">e, yet so genius. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Thanks, Youtube!)</span></p>\n<h3>3. How frequently are you going to clean them?</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now this one, you need to </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">be</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> honest about. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Nobody stays on top of their cleaning as much as they’d like to. (Or maybe you do. Don’t judge me!)  Really though, how often will</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">actually</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> bother looking at how dusty your blinds are?</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you want to keep blinds clean, you need to wipe them down once a week or so.

A tiny tree is one of the easiest and most common decorations for small spaces. I decorate my miniature tree with an over-the-top tree topper, festive ornaments, and twinkling fairy lights. I also like to sweeten it up with a few candy canes. Even though it’s tiny, I love how my Christmas tree lights up the room with its larger-than-life presence.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6093\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Half of a Christmas Tree<br />\n</strong>I admit this one requires an open mind.

But, after a few sleepless nights up thinking about it (it <em>really</em> bothered me), I realized its brilliance!</p>\n<p>Tuck this slim, festive fellow in a corner for all the fun of a full-size Christmas tree for half the space. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/TANGKULA-Artificial-Christmas-Half-Shape-Decoration/dp/B081MYBNG7/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=half+christmas+tree&amp;qid=1574640178&amp;sr=8-16\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/Home-Heritage-7-Ft-Pre-Lit-Artificial-Half-Christmas-Tree-with-Folding-Stand/PRD1TCPD0VT30L5\">Walmart</a> sell cheap but high-quality half Christmas trees.</p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Tree Doesn’t Need to be Pine<br />\n</strong>When you imagine a Christmas tree, you’re automatically going to picture a lush, green pine tree.

I like to decorate the <a href=\"https://www.shelmerdine.com/product/fiddle-leaf-fig-tree/\">fiddle leaf fig tree</a> in my bedroom with bulbs, holly and candy canes. It’s quirky and brings so much character to the room.</p>\n<p><strong>Festive Fairy Light Tree<br />\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Kohree-Changing-Decorative-Stroller-DecorTree/dp/B01HO0RVCI/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=fairy+lights&amp;qid=1574642608&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-7\">Fairy lights</a> have so many uses; you can string them up or get creative! When I was first settling into my downtown apartment and wasn’t sure if I wanted to invest in a tree, I created one myself. Pair your fairy lights with garland and pin them up on your wall in the shape of a pine tree (or a fiddle leaf fig tree!), and you’ve got yourself a DIY Christmas tree. Be creative: you can attach bulbs or even candy canes to it, just like a real tree.</p>\n<p>This trick can also be used as a decoration hack for those who celebrate other holidays. Creating a Star of David with the lights on your wall is just as simple and beautiful!</p>\n<h3>Mantel Makeover</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty lucky; my apartment has a brick fireplace with a beautiful oak mantel. If you have a fireplace, decorating the mantel is an easy way to display small decorations without taking up floor space.</p>\n<p>Since I like to keep the rest of my living room fairly simple for Holiday decorating, I make the mantle my centerpiece. I prefer traditional Christmas colours, so I decorate my mantel with deep greens by pinning a flocked pine wreath above the fireplace and draping garland across the mantle. I then strategically place crimson-red holly within the garland and finish the look by pinning up a few red stockings. The stockings also draw my guests’ eyes down to the burning fire underneath, completing the cozy look I’m going for.</p>\n<p><strong>Utilizing Holiday Cards</strong><br />\nI don’t know about you, but as soon as December 1st hits I’m bombarded with <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/search?q=christmas+card&amp;locationQuery=6183235\">holiday cards</a> from family, friends and co-workers. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but at first I was confused about what to do with all of them. Eventually, inspiration struck and I started selecting a few with the most festive illustrations to display on my mantel behind my garland. Not only do they make cheerful decorations, they also remind me of my loved ones.</p>\n<h3>Deck the Halls—Literally!</h3>\n<p><strong>Mistletoe<br />\n</strong>Mistletoe is a winter classic that doesn’t take up any space at all. All you need is a doorway, such as in a hallway, to let the festive smooches begin!</p>\n<p><strong>Paper Snowflakes</strong><br />\nI love decorating my space with <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-6-Pointed-Paper-Snowflakes/\">paper snowflakes</a>. They make me feel so nostalgic about being a kid and spending all winter snipping them out with safety scissors. As an adult, they’re an inexpensive decoration that brings the romance of snow into your home – without the chill.</p>\n<p>I personally like stringing paper snowflakes up on the ceiling, letting them drape down to bring a touch of magic to an entranceway. Try hanging them by a window where they can catch the every-changing winter light.</p>\n<h3>Create a Holiday Scent</h3>\n<p>So, your place looks festive…but does it smell festive? <a href=\"https://www.charlestonandharlow.com/collections/fall-holiday\">Scented candles</a> are the easiest way to bring a merry aroma to your apartment. Cinnamon, gingerbread, fire and pine are a few of my favourite scented candle fragrances; all these are super easy to find in your favourite candle shop!

It can sometimes be hard for communities with fast-growing populations to keep up with the infrastructure needs for new residents. That’s why many cities are gravitating towards more high-density housing as part of their “<a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/urban-density-and-sustainability/241696/\">smart growth</a>” strategies.</p>\n<h3>What is High-Density Housing?</h3>\n<p>High-density housing simply is housing that packs more people per geographic unit. For example, <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a> is a 40-storey apartment building that will be home to several hundred city dwellers. Communities that are urbanizing sometimes encourage developers to add higher-density complexes to their downtown areas. There are many advantages to these tall multiplexes.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6065\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6065\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://300main.ca/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6065\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Final_C2-1024x775.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-300x227.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-770x583.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-500x379.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-293x222.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-1400x1060.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6065\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">3D Rendering of 300 Main</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Higher-density neighbourhoods have a strong sense of community and connectedness because people are just in closer contact with each other. High-density housing usually entails high-rise buildings such as 300 Main. Higher population density is essential for <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/ypnexthome/high-density-housing-gta_b_17208346.html\">developing busy, vivacious neighbourhoods</a> with lots of features. It allows for beautiful public spaces like downtown Winnipeg to make life convenient, enjoyable and, most importantly, green!</p>\n<h3>Sustainable Design</h3>\n<p>As cities <a href=\"https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2019/04/canadas-major-cities-ride-slipstream-surging-population-growth\">boom in population</a> and invest to meet the needs of their new citizens, sustainability has also become a major focus. High-rise apartments are one of the easiest ways to make a community more sustainable. They have a smaller footprint than that of many smaller buildings.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6069\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6069\" style=\"width: 680px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6069\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg, Chicago, High Rise Buildings in Chicago, High Rise Apartments in Chicago\" width=\"680\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-199x300.jpg 199w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-770x1159.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-500x752.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-293x441.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3.jpg 901w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6069\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chicago, United States by Cameron Casey from Pexels</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If neighbourhoods want to continue to grow, all they need to do is look up! Building up, or even on top of, is <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2012/01/why-most-environmental-building-building-weve-already-built/1016/\">more environmentally-friendly</a> than conventional demolished-site redevelopment.</p>\n<h3>Size Matters (For Energy)</h3>\n<p>Denser neighbourhoods that include apartment blocks or condos also use less energy. Residences that are stacked or bunched should <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/life/homes/modern-housing-why-highrises-are-good-for-the-environment\">use less energy</a>. For example, an apartment suite in 300 Main is more efficient to heat and cool than a detached suburban house. So even on cold winter nights (which us Winnipeggers know sometimes start in October), if every apartment suite were to turn their heat up, they’d be using less energy than the equivalent number of houses. Higher-density neighbourhoods also <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths/\">create fewer harmful emissions</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2012/04/why-bigger-cities-are-greener/863/\">Richard Florida at CityLab</a> says, “When it comes to greenness, <a href=\"http://martinprosperity.org/insights/insight/cities-and-co2-bigger-is-better\">size matters</a>.”</p>\n<h3>Encourages more Walking, Cycling and Use of Public Transportation</h3>\n<p>Though downtown areas can seem busy, there are major benefits to living and working downtown. Dense downtown neighbourhoods help residents drive less and walk more, without giving up their lifestyles. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40492045/living-in-a-dense-city-makes-citizens-healthier\">Research</a> has shown that lower density promotes sedentary behavior. If your home is far away from the grocery store and your office, you’re going to spend more time in a car and less time being active.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Pxt5HlTeqB\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/\">Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/embed/#?secret=Pxt5HlTeqB\" data-secret=\"Pxt5HlTeqB\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>High-density housing encourages walking and cycling <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths/\">because everything is closer</a> together! Transit is also promoted by high-density housing, as transit connections become more common when neighborhood density increases. Many city dwellers find it more convenient to jump on a transit bus and be at work in a stress-free jiffy, rather than drive to work, deal with traffic, and find parking. Talk about a headache!</p>\n<p>Individuals who live in suburban areas can also benefit from people taking transit to work. Fewer cars on the road equal fewer harmful emissions, like carbon dioxide.</p>\n<h3>What’s Big, Green, and Sustainable?</h3>\n<p>High-density housing is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/jun/30/sustainable-cities-urban-planning\">sustainable choice</a> for growing cities. Tall buildings are more than just towers of concrete and steel; they’re a fundamental part of successful urbanization. They offer a greener, less wasteful, and more energy-efficient way of life.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6072\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6072\" style=\"width: 954px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6072\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-954x1024.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg, New York, New York Apartment Buildings\" width=\"954\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-954x1024.jpg 954w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-279x300.jpg 279w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-770x827.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-500x537.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-293x315.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-1400x1503.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New York, United States by Craig Adderley from Pexels</figcaption></figure></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Canadians are increasingly living in cities, and Winnipeg is no exception.

This piece of furniture or pair of shoes will last, will indeed be timeless.</p>\n<p>In my living room stands a small, mustard-yellow, mid-century sofa. Was this style of sofa fashionable in the 1950s? Absolutely. Is it fashionable today? Certainly. Will it be fashionable in twenty years? I dare say so. Having those three definite answers in mind helped me decide to buy that piece of furniture. Asking if it was timeless helped even more when my subconscious decided I would enjoy this sofa for the next twenty years.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6036\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-100x100.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-770x770.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-293x293.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-390x390.jpg 390w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-585x585.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-900x900.jpg 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-1400x1400.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/inside-weather-Ijk3UP9uRhk-unsplash-2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Some things might be considered fundamentals of timeless fashion, but what’s timeless for each of us might be different. What we decide to call <em>lasting</em> and <em>classic</em> depends on our ideas of current and vintage trends. It comes from our backgrounds, preferences, and our feelings.</p>\n<p>I might call my yellow sofa timeless, but it might not be something you want to see in your living room every day for the next twenty years. I know why the tweed Chanel suit is considered beautiful and timeless, but it’s just not for me. When it comes to home décor, the same rules apply; each piece of furniture should suit your vision and your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The point of such a talky introduction was only to get us thinking about and appreciating the things we own. In a fast-paced world full of issues such as climate change, plastic and fast-fashion production, we ought to pay attention to the quality and durability of our clothes and furniture. Building a wardrobe and home centered on timeless pieces will make a positive difference to both your life and the environment. Let’s look at the process of searching for décor that will last.</p>\n<h3>1. Stay away from clichés</h3>\n<p>A home that evokes sighs of admiration with its timeless style wasn&#8217;t decorated in a week. Everything that deserves attention, anything that will last, takes time, love and effort to find. I’m not trying to judge Costco or IKEA. However, I tend to believe in other, more sophisticated and exciting ways of discovering your home essentials.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6038\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, ikea\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Current trends, which tell us to live more organically and embrace slow-fashion and slow-living, affect our ideas about the right way to shop.

When people hear the word “boutique,” they tend to imagine high-end pieces with high-end prices. But you’d be surprised by the quality you can find at affordable prices My yellow couch, for example, cost just under $600, and the quality and the style are tremendous!</li>\n<li>Frequent local marketplaces that feature artists and makers. These markets, like <a href=\"https://alleywaysmarket.ca/\">Alleyways Market</a> or <a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\">Third + Bird</a>, can be found throughout the year in Winnipeg. Many artists will have examples at their booths that can be pre-ordered or purchased on the spot. I’ve found beautiful wooden side tables, kitchen items made from olive wood, and handmade woven baskets that are great for décor and storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg\" alt=\"third + bird\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg 800w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-300x150.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-770x385.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-500x250.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-585x293.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-293x147.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go treasure hunting at thrift stores and second-hand places. Sure, sometimes you’ll leave empty-handed, but you might also leave with pieces that will suit your style and serve you loyally. Search thrift stores for small details like a magazine stand, books, candelabras or even seasonal decorations. You’ll find unique pieces while doing your part for the environment by reusing, recycling, and restyling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Add culture to your place</h3>\n<p>My great-grandmother was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruska_Roma\">Ruska Roma</a>. Learning this explained a lot about my preferences. Every time I promised myself that I would keep my house minimalistic, and style it simply with bohemian pieces, I would find something a colourful carpet, golden candle holder, or velvet pillow I couldn’t resist.</p>\n<p>Don’t let a fear of being different blind you. Don’t force yourself to follow trends and clichés if you feel no connection to it. I’m not saying to surround yourself with only appropriate cultural pieces. You don’t want your home to be a museum; you want it to be your home that reflects who you are and feels comfortable and warm. Add culture by mixing in art pieces (maybe something you picked up while travelling) with modern furniture for a timeless look.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6045\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, bohemian\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Imagine a room where the main pieces, like the sofa, chairs, and table, are simple, but the room feels full of character. Look closer, and you will notice more than basic furniture. Is that a rug from India? Are there French impressionist paintings? Photographs? Are there handmade vases from Poland? Discover what your culture is about and sprinkle it throughout your home.</p>\n<h3>3. Let the basics be timeless</h3>\n<p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: everyone has their own interpretation of what makes something timeless. However, there are some standard rules for choosing timeless pieces.</p>\n<p>Allow bigger pieces such as sofas, dining tables, kitchen cabinets, and your bed to be timeless. The same rules that apply in fashion apply to interior design: keep your essential wardrobe and basic furniture functional and timeless. Then, add trendy or cultural notes to it seasonally.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6046\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Timeless furniture makes a functional base but doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. Research the epoch you find the most delightful or interesting and be inspired by its designs. Pay attention to descriptions such as “retro”, “mid-century” and “contemporary”; you might even keep an eye out for “Victorian” if you like a bit of pomp. Use these pieces fearlessly as your basics.</p>\n<p>If cultural or trendy decorative details suit your personality, then timeless furniture is your neutral base. The more timeless and essential your main furniture is, the longer it will stay with you. You merely won&#8217;t get tired of its appearance and presence.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>The advice that helped me: start a mood board (physical or just on Pinterest) and do your research. Collect ideas for timeless (but not dull and boring!) interior design pieces. Then, enjoy the slow thrill of the furniture hunt at antique stores, little unknown shops. Search Instagram for artists and handcrafters; you might find unique dish sets, side tables, pillows and baskets. When you’re finished, your home will be more than just a shelter. It will be full of useful, uncommon pieces that have a story behind them; pieces that serve you and express your individuality. And that’s truly timeless.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What are your favourite places for finding unique, lasting pieces of furniture?

Unfortunately, my dormitory wouldn’t let me paint the walls, which is standard in a rental.

If that sounds like you, this is the perfect solution to your wall-based conflict! Divide your wall into sections and decorate it with collages of artwork, mirrors and larger décor/paintings. Perhaps your style leans more towards weavings, like this <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/677226640/50-shades?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;frs=1\">cool piece from Winnipeg artist Rebecca Riel</a>.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6012\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6012\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6012\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Lena Malevitis from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Use Complementary Colours</h3>\n<p>This ties in with covering the wall in art. It might seem difficult to compliment a colour you hate, but this tip can really add to your décor. For example, to deal with my lime green walls I added muted and neutral tones. I used black and white photographs, a darker green tapestry and a mocha-coloured mirror. Even though I was working with the colour of the wall, it worked with my style and drew more attention to it.</p>\n<p>For help finding colour inspiration, <a href=\"https://www.architecturelab.net/\">www.architecturelab.net</a> is a great resource.</p>\n<h3>Reflect with a Mirror</h3>\n<p>A sculptural <a href=\"https://www.picturesframesandmore.com/mirrors/page-id-166/Decorative/\">mirror</a> is a great, eye-pleasing way to direct attention away from the wall.

For instance, one of Winnipeg’s most popular thrift stores, <a href=\"https://www.valuevillage.com/\">Value Village</a>, donates a large portion of their proceeds back into the community.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personal impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>My favorite item in my downtown apartment is a unique, red oak coffee table that I copped from <a href=\"http://canadiangoodwill.ca/\">Goodwill</a> for just $12! Amazed by my deal, I looked online—similar items sold for $150. Need I say more?</p>\n<h3>How to Shop Secondhand Décor</h3>\n<p>Friendly reminder that when you buy used, you’re technically sharing with the previous owners. Check fabric and upholstered pieces carefully before making your purchase. Always check for M.O.P.S: mildew, odors, pests and stains!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shop prepared</strong></em></p>\n<p>Knowing the measurements of the room you want to decorate is key! There’s nothing worse than coming home with your dream rug only to realize it’s way too big for your space. Measure the room beforehand, write the measurements down, and bring a measuring tape with you when you go shopping. These simple precautions will save you so much hassle.</p>\n<p>Focus on key pieces first, rather than browsing everything. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when thrifting. You might be on a mission for a coffee table but end up lost among dozens of decorative mirrors.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Look for potential, not perfection</strong></em></p>\n<p>Thrifted goods likely won’t look perfect when you purchase them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t right for your space.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5990\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Know your style</strong></em></p>\n<p>Combining a variety of decorating styles can be a cool, edgy look, but only when done carefully. Avoid decorating seasickness by carefully considering two questions: What’s your existing style, and what colour scheme are you going for?</p>\n<p>You’re decorating a space that you’ll be spending a lot of time in. Make sure you like the items you bring into your space and that they reflect your personal style. You’re doing no one any good by decorating the space in fads and trends that you really don’t truly like. And having an assortment of colours and furniture can be a pretty, eccentric look, but there should always be an overall colour scheme to keep your room cohesive.</p>\n<h3>What to Buy New</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Mattress</strong></em></p>\n<p>When it comes to mattress shopping, I have two words for you: bed bugs! A mattress is one of the most important things to buy after signing the lease to your new apartment. I think it goes without saying that buying a used mattress is a no-no. Bed bugs are great hitchhikers!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Crib</strong></em></p>\n<p>Having a baby is expensive, but a crib is not something you should want to skimp on. Buying a used crib is risky, because you don’t know what type of internal damage there might be.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pet furniture</strong></em></p>\n<p>You have no way of knowing what previous pets were up to on second-hand pet beds, crates, blankets or toys. To ensure your furry friend has a clean and safe place to sit or sleep, avoid buying pet items second-hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer thrifting or buying new for your apartment?

Even if it’s not your favourite thing, choose furniture carefully to ensure you have a happy, comfortable abode. There is no one style that will suit everyone, so let’s look at some things you should consider before you furnish your digs.</p>\n<h3>The Living Room</h3>\n<p>We’ll start in the living room or family room. You’ve got options when it comes to your furniture upholstery, such as leather, wood or fabric. What will work best for you depends on a few factors.</p>\n<p>Nice furnishings don’t always mix well with children or clawed pets. If you have small children or a feline who loves to scratch, you might want to save yourself some heartache and avoid expensive materials like leather.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5964\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-770x577.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should also consider the temperature you tend to keep your home at. If you like thing on the warm side, be aware that leather can stick to bare skin. There’s nothing fun about the sting that follows peeling your body off leather furniture. On the other hand, leather is durable and comfy to sink into. For the vegans or vegetarians among you, leather is likely out, so you may want to consider <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vimle-sofa-with-chaise-farsta-dark-brown-s79206994/\">artificial leather</a> or a different type of upholstery.</p>\n<p>Wood can be nice for some furnishings, but you don’t want an entire couch made of it. (Imagine trying to take an afternoon nap on that.) Wood can stand up to Fluffy and her talons, though, so you might look for couches and chairs that pair wood frames with fabric coverings if you have a particularly-destructive cat. Wood gives a room a nice look and has great durability. I have cube-shaped, solid-wood end tables that I can stand on. They’re great for when my short frame needs to dust high places. Places like <a href=\"https://www.biglowwoodcraft.com/\">Biglow Woodcraft</a> make beautiful pieces right here in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5961\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"681\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-770x1157.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-500x751.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-1400x2104.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" /></p>\n<p>Cost is another factor when we decide what to buy. Leather and wood tend to be more expensive than fabric, so they might end up out of your price range. When considering cost, think about how long you intend to have that piece of furniture. Some people want to buy something and use it forever, and others like to change up their décor regularly. You may want to spend a bit less if you can’t see yourself liking the same desk or chair for years; you’ll want to replace it eventually.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5966\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>The size of your space also plays a major role in your furniture shopping. You might love the idea of a gigantic sectional so all your friends can come over and watch Jets games, but a sectional won’t work in a tiny apartment. Instead, you might choose something like this <a href=\"https://www.thesefourwalls.ca/sofas-sectionals/axis-sofa\">plush-looking condo sofa</a>. My home is small, so we’ve gotten good at picking up furniture that fits in our space. Some people look at Ikea with disdain, but it’s a great place to find <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/rooms_ideas/small_spaces/index.html\">pieces designed for small spaces</a>. We wanted a futon for our spare bedroom/office, but the room doesn’t have space for a double-sized futon. Ikea came to our rescue with a <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vallentuna-sleeper-module-with-backrests-hillared-light-blue-s49277488/\">chair futon</a> that folds out into a single bed. It’s also super comfy!</p>\n<p>You can look for other furniture that does double duty. We store cooking magazines inside an <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/product/fay-storage-ottoman--alexa-steel-212122.html?cgid=LIVING-SEATING-OTTOMANSBENCHES#sz=12&amp;start=21\">ottoman that opens up to double as storage</a>. Floating shelves look good and provide storage for books and knick-knacks.</p>\n<h3>The Dining Experience</h3>\n<p>Does your dining room table simply act as a repository for your mail and random objects? Or do you fancy yourself a chef and do a lot of entertaining? If you’re more the chef type, choose your table wisely. Will you have enough room for your friends and family to gather around?</p>\n<p>Look for a table that extends if you sometimes need to serve a larger group. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.designmanitoba.com/store/p2052/Nexus_Extendable_table_by_Amisco.html\">extendable tables</a> are not all equal. How easy is it to extend/collapse? Do you have to store the extra leaf somewhere else? We bought a great table from <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/home/\">Urban Barn</a> a few years ago. It extends so we can host a crowd, and one person can set up the extension without help. The extra leaf butterflies and folds down under the table, so we don’t have to store it anywhere else in our already-tight space. It’s a far cry from the tables of old that needed (at least) two people and an engineering degree to add or remove a huge leaf, which took up valuable storage space when not in use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5968\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Pay attention to your <a href=\"https://www.thebrick.com/collections/furniture-dining-room-chairs\">dining chairs</a>, too. Do people often linger at your table? If so, choose chairs that can be comfortable for a few hours. When we bought our table, we had the option of purchasing coordinating benches that would have seated 3 people each. They were beautiful, solid wood benches—and horribly uncomfortable. We found wood-framed chairs with leather upholstery instead, so our guests don’t need to visit the chiropractor after dining with us.</p>\n<p>Chairs also allow you to show off your personal style. You can choose chairs all in the same subdued hue or add a bit of flair and a pop of colour! We had 4 different colour options when we bought our dining chairs and couldn’t decide which we liked better. So we bought 2 of each colour! Our <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\">mismatched chairs</a> add a bit of whimsy to our slate grey table.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px; border: #eee 1px solid;\" src=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Technology Can Help You Decide</h3>\n<p>When looking for furniture, you can download a room design app to help you decide what you want! It’s fun to virtually plan out a room to see what it might look like and what will fit. With the right app, you can do more than use your imagination when you are trying to decide what works and doesn’t. Here’s an article that links to some <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-7-best-apps-for-room-design-amp-room-layout-244213\">popular room design apps you can try</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d still recommend going to showrooms, since look and size are only part of the picture when it comes to choosing furniture. I’m always most concerned with comfort and practicality in my furniture, but you can choose to go entirely online for your furniture buying. Either way, take the time to do your research and think about what you truly need. Buying furniture is far more expensive than buying clothes and you’ll be living with your decisions for a long time. Don’t get stuck with buyer’s remorse when it comes to your furniture!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Where is your favourite place to shop for furniture in Winnipeg?

You want it to change. You’re just not sure what that means or where to begin.</p>\n<p>No, I’m not about to tell you what to do with it. I am by no means an expert; I have found myself in your predicament more than once. Typically, my fix was calling my sister and brother-in-law for guidance. I’ve called them for help for something as simple as a colour choice. (At least, I thought it was simple!)</p>\n<p>I can’t offer up their phone number, but I can tell you that getting an outside opinion is never a bad idea. But who should you call?</p>\n<p>I called on Kelly Porath. Kelly is the force behind <a href=\"https://www.blueroseinteriors.com/\">Blue Rose Interiors</a>, a Winnipeg-based interior design firm. You may know Kelly from her segments on CTV Morning Live with Terri Apostle.

You have come to the conclusion that your office is simply not conducive to getting work done. It never gets direct sunlight and its decor doesn’t help. In fact, you think that it makes the room feel even smaller.</p>\n<p>You want that to change. After all, the idea of having a home office is one of the reasons you chose this apartment in the first place!</p>\n<p>With this scenario in mind, Kelly provided a few pointers to solve your office dilemma.</p>\n<p><strong>Paint</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dark colours absorb light and light ones reflect more light into the space.</li>\n<li>Never pick your paint colours in the store.</li>\n<li>Walk around the space, holding your paint sample.</li>\n<li>Consider painting the entire room a single colour to unify the space, making it feel larger.</li>\n<li>Use a neutral colour as a backdrop, and then use accent pieces to bring in colour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5928\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Mirrors</strong></p>\n<p>Reflective surfaces make a space feel larger. A mirror can make the walls feel as if they have moved out. Having said that, how you position a mirror is very important. Be aware of what the mirror will reflect and don’t install them too high. If hanging a mirror over a sofa, position the mirror so its bottom edge is 6 to 9 inches above the back of the couch. The mirror’s size should be proportional to the size of the room.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5929\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>\n<p>In general, people will not spend time in a dark room. They’ll instinctively move to a well-lit room instead. No surprise here; you’re living that reality now!</p>\n<p>Begin by considering the ambient lighting⁠—the natural light entering the space, as well as any artificial lighting that may already exist. When decorating an office, consider task lighting. Task lighting is the light needed to perform a certain task, such as reading or working on a desktop.</p>\n<p>Finally, make sure to use a combination of table and floor lamps in order to balance the lighting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5930\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Furniture</strong></p>\n<p>The key to a well-styled room is to make sure that your furniture is proportionate to the size of the room. If you kept your favourite furnishings in your most recent move, ask yourself how well they fit your new home. Remember they were purchased to fit a different space. You may need to purchase new pieces that fit your new space.</p>\n<p>And finally, avoid “small item-itis.” Visual clutter makes a space feel smaller. Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>\n<h3>Thank you, Kelly!</h3>\n<p>Kelly provided some great tips to get you back into your hypothetical office. Many of her tips can be applied to any decorating situation!</p>\n<p>While browsing Kelly’s website, I came across this insightful line: “Your environment shapes your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.” That struck a chord with me and has made me appreciate even more the guidance that I have received over the years from my sister and brother-in law. It also really made me appreciate the value that a professional like Kelly brings to the table.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Kelly and the Blue Rose Interiors story, visit blueroseinteriors.com or find Blue Rose Interiors on Facebook.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There’s always that one room⁠—you know the one.

There’s nothing more relaxing and rejuvenating than enjoying nature. One of my favourite places in downtown during fall is along the Assiniboine River—I love the crisp air and the carpet of leaves crunching beneath my feet as I stroll the path. It’s always confounded me that the sound of dead leaves can make the air crackle with life.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></p>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Denise Runions (@msdeerun)</a> on Oct 22, 2016 at 11:02am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My route usually starts at the Forks, where I grab a steaming cup of joe from <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>. Warming beverage in hand, I make my way west, ending up outside the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a>. Even when other people are using the path, the river walkway is a serene place to spend autumn days.</p>\n<h3>Hot Drinks to Warm You Up (&amp; Where to Find Them)</h3>\n<p>The fragrant aromas of apple cider and hot cocoa are the ultimate reminder that fall is in the air! Downtown Winnipeg is the hub for the top-of-the-line coffee shops, and the place to be to satisfy your pumpkin-spiced cravings. Coffee shops such as <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/home-blend\">Thom Bargen</a> or <a href=\"https://secondcup.com/location/254-edmonton-street\">Second Cup Coffee Co.</a> are some of my top-picks for their seasonal drink menus. Here are some of my favourite seasonal drinks, guaranteed to have you feeling warm and toasty from the inside out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\"><strong>Fools and Horses</strong></a><br />\nFools and Horses is not afraid to get a little creative with hot fall drinks; they offer pumpkin spice lattes, but their Boreal Latte truly shines!

I hate to even say the dreaded w word yet, but there are many perks to underground heated parking—especially during Winnipeg’s harsh winters! Here are some of the best reasons to look for parking underground.</p>\n<h3>No More Morning Duties</h3>\n<p>If you are like me and value your sleep, a giant perk of heated underground parking is that you save major time in the morning. Instead of waking up twenty minutes earlier to bundle up, trudge outside, and work up a sweat clearing inches of snow and ice off your car, only to then wait another miserable ten minutes for your car to warm up, you can be in bed hitting your snooze button for the third time. With heated underground parking, you don’t have to spend half of your day preparing your car for departure, you just hop in and go!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5887\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5887\" style=\"width: 819px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5887\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Heated Parking, Parkade, Underground Parkade, Winnipeg Square Parkade, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, snowy road, winter street\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-770x963.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-293x366.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-1400x1750.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Ian Keefe from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>You’ll also have somewhere to plug in your car, guaranteeing it will start on those extra toe-numbing days that always come around in January. A warm underground parking spot will also protect your wheels from the elements, so it won’t be 100% dependent on being plugged in.</p>\n<h3>Keeping Your Car Clean</h3>\n<p>Winnipeg roads are the epitome of dirty—especially on groggy winter days when it’s almost impossible not to drive into a pothole full of brown slush. Sometimes, you just want to make your car all spiffy but fear the mix of the leftover water and Winnipeg’s frigid days. But if you’re headed back to your cozy, underground heated parking spot afterwards, you can scrub your car without a care in the world. Plus, underground parking ensures you’ll be taking fewer trips to the carwash by avoiding those extra splashes of dirt your car would receive parked on the street.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5890\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"Heated Parking, Parkade, Underground Parkade, Winnipeg Square Parkade, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, snowy road, winter street, slushy winter, muddy car\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-770x511.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-500x332.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-1400x930.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Keeping Your Car Safe</h3>\n<p>Your car is less likely to be dinged or damaged by passing cars when it’s parked safely underground. And if you do have the misfortune of receiving a ding from a car door or a smashed bumper, most underground parking lots have security cameras. So if the offending driver didn’t leave a note, you might be able to find out how it happened. Underground parking also helps protects you from those always ill-timed street parking break-ins.</p>\n<h3>No More Parking Tickets</h3>\n<p>“Be right back, I need to go move my car!”</p>\n<p>Sound familiar? Underground parking also saves you from getting a parking ticket (or three). Many underground parking lots have you pick up a ticket when you enter and pay for your time when you leave. So no rushing to move your car each hour, or leaving your dinner date to go plug more quarters into the meter. If you have the option of including parking in your rent, that’s even more convenient!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FWinnipegMomOnline%2Fposts%2F1878140362231098&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"632\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3>Save Big on Time and Energy</h3>\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is known for having limited parking on their streets, especially during the 9 to 5 on workdays.

All-Star Poets Compete For Your Scores!</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/\">Thom Bargen Coffee and Tea</a></strong></p>\n<p>Having been a member of the spoken word community for a long time, I was pleased to be asked to perform at Winnipeg Poetry Slam’s Nuit Blanche event. I was also part of the Winnipeg Poetry Slam team for 2018, which later competed in the National Poetry Slam in Guelph, part of the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word.</p>\n<p>For Nuit Blanche, seven of us poets got together, and we gave art lovers a show to start off the night! It was a great opportunity for me because I was able to introduce new friends of mine to the spoken word community; they&#8217;d never been to a poetry slam before and had no idea what to expect. I find that these are often the best minds to have at a poetry slam, as they&#8217;re the most receptive and will get the most out of the poetry itself. With a small group of artists, poets, and other art enthusiasts in tow, I started us off on our journey through Nuit Blanche. Here are a few of the installations we saw as we ventured forth into the night.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fvideos%2F171998770396697%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/our-communities/metro/Whimsical-art-piece-a-first-for-Wolseley-artist-493489791.html\">&#8220;Hand of the Machine&#8221; by Solmund MacPherson</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/branchpages/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library</a> Courtyard</strong></p>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Nuit Blanche Winnipeg. Situated next to another installation (“<a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/emptyful\">emptyful</a>”) in the courtyard behind the Millennium Library was our first installation of the night: a massive and well-lit hand stretching out into the night air, with control levers that moved the fingers. In some cases, interactive art installations are built to last. But by the time we arrived, about an hour and a half into Nuit Blanche, the middle finger was broken and hanging limp in the middle of the palm. While we were there, I also saw the installation fall forward more than once, like a wrestler trying to tap out. Instead, someone picked it up and put it back into the fight. Before leaving we grabbed a few free books from the assortment the library had set up, and I played a game of oversized Connect 4.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve never herd of bison&#8221; by Kale Bonham and Todd Scott</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/\"><strong>Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park</strong></a></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fphotos%2Fa.1673473746070347%2F2146671585417225%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"535\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t think I appreciated this installation enough. It was a group of sound-activated bison next to the illumination board that lines the back side of Upper Fort Garry Park. When we got there, there wasn&#8217;t much noise to trigger the bison to react, so we moved on quickly. However, I&#8217;ve since seen images of the installation reacting to crowds of people, and it looks quite interesting!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://woodanchor.com/img_0496/\">&#8220;Run For Your Lite&#8221; by Wood Anchor and Cloverdale Forge</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/things-to-do/attractions/display,listing/05735/esplanade-riel-pedestrian-bridge\">Esplanade Riel bridge</a> landing</strong></p>\n<p>After a stop in <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/attractions/the-forks-market\">The Forks Market</a> to grab a bite to eat and a coffee, we moved on to the next few installations, but none caught my eye like this one. You could see the installation for what it was: Free energy. It took the form of a large wooden &#8220;hamster wheel&#8221; with a handle bar to grip, covered with lights and connected to turbines that would not only illuminate the installation but also power a nearby forge.

It seemed like 5 to 8 minutes was the best folks could handle before the momentum started making them slip or lose their balance. It was definitely entertaining to watch as we ate the food we bought (seating inside was impossible to find) before walking up to Waterfront to move on to the Exchange District.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://connectingcities.net/project/control-no-control\">&#8220;Control No Control&#8221; by Daniel Iregui</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/shipping-container-exhibit/\">&#8220;Container Architecture&#8221; by Winnipeg Architecture Foundation</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Bijou Park, East of Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/57144334\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Setup alongside Old Market Square, Bijou Park (which hosts Kids Fringe activities during the summer festival) hosted two displays during this year&#8217;s Nuit Blanche. On one side of the park, &#8220;Control No Control&#8221; featured a massive LED panel that reacted to both touch and sound input from the ever-growing crowd around it. On the other side of the park, nestled up to the side of Smoke&#8217;s Poutinerie, the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation set up a converted shipping container. It featured various other architectural projects around the world, showcasing the use of shipping containers as raw materials to build sustainable structures and housing. As a big supporter of sustainable living initiatives, this struck home with me.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/impulse\">&#8220;Impulse&#8221; presented by The Winnipeg Arts Council</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRG4PMlY38Y\" width=\"324\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One of the biggest installations I’ve seen, &#8220;Impulse&#8221; was a collection of massive light-beam seesaws for riders of all ages. No matter how many videos or pictures I tried to take of this spectacle, none could do it justice. Every face in Old Market Square that night was filled with excitement and exhilaration!</p>\n<p>There were many other ways for everyone to enjoy Nuit Blanche last year, including community events, gallery shows, and live exhibitions throughout the night.

I’m not sure if there’s any actual science behind that, but in my mind, it’s a fact.</p>\n<p>The days can still be hot and sunny, but the sun rises later, the mornings are cooler and a 10 pm sunset is a distant memory. It’s too early to think about winter, and definitely too early to give up on enjoying a Winnipeg summer.</p>\n<p>And to me, that means continuing to spend as much time as possible outdoors, enjoying picnics! Yes, you heard me right: good, old-fashioned picnics. Winnipeg makes it easy as, with abundant public parks and green spaces where you can spread your picnic blanket. Most Winnipeg parks are open from 7 am to 10 pm.</p>\n<p>Here is my list of four parks in Winnipeg that should be at the top of your picnic list!</p>\n<h3>Bruce Park</h3>\n<p><em>1966 Portage Ave.</em></p>\n<p>Truth be told, I never knew that Bruce Park existed until a friend told me! The embarrassing part is that I have driven by this park countless times. It just goes to show how often we don’t really notice what is right there in front of us.</p>\n<p>Sitting on 4.4 hectares of land south of Portage Avenue, and just east of the Assiniboine Park foot bridge, Bruce Park offers a number of options for picnickers. It has a few tables, a few well-placed benches, and plenty of space to roll out a blanket.</p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Quiet refuge away from the hustle and bustle of downtown life.</p>\n<p>• Parking access is available from the lane that borders the park to the west.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities only available when the pool is open.</p>\n<h3>Crescent Drive Park</h3>\n<p><em>781 Crescent Drive</em></p>\n<p>There are so many reasons to love this park. From the wildlife that shares its space, to the Red River that passes it by. Wildlife, you ask? In addition to birds and squirrels, a number of deer call Crescent Drive Park home. There’s also a monarch butterfly garden nearby. Visit at the right time of year, and you may find yourself being entertained by these little beauties.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5840\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5840\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crescent Drive Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Natural setting along the Red River, close to <a href=\"https://www.thermea.ca/\">Thermëa</a> and the <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/golf/crescent.stm\">Crescent Drive Golf Course</a>.</p>\n<p>• Plenty of parking.</p>\n<p>• BBQ pits available.</p>\n<p>• Portable toilets provided while a new picnic shelter and washroom facilities being rebuilt.</p>\n<h3>La Barrière Park</h3>\n<p><em>4403 Waverley St.</em></p>\n<p>While not technically in Winnipeg, La Barrière Park is just too good to leave off this list!</p>\n<p>I first fell in love with La Barrière Park in winter because it’s a great place to walk my dogs. It now calls to me year-round, with or without the dogs. Its trails lead you over the La Salle River and through a mature forest where you can run, jog, or walk. The slow-moving La Salle River is quite popular with paddlers. My camera also professes a love for this park, and always finds something to capture.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5841\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5841\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5841 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">La Barriere Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Proximity to the city and variety of picnic settings to choose from.</p>\n<p>• Interesting nature trails.</p>\n<p>• BBQ pits available.</p>\n<p>• Sites available to book for larger groups.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities on site.</p>\n<h3>Assiniboine Forest</h3>\n<p><em>Situated between Chalfont Avenue to the west and Shaftsbury Boulevard to the east.</em></p>\n<p>Finally, la pièce de résistance! If you want to feel like you are in a natural park and without leaving the city, Assiniboine Forest is the place for you. This park will appeal to both the explorer and the observer in you. Its trails range in length from 1.1 km to 2.8 km, and lead you through everything from thick forest to wetlands.

Manitoba summers bring beautiful weather, and there is no shortage of things to do outside while soaking up the sun and staying active. With scenic architecture, beautiful trails, green parks, and tons of events, downtown is full things to see while you stay active this summer.</p>\n<h3>Follow the Riverwalk</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about downtown is the <a href=\"https://www.travelmanitoba.com/listings/the-forks-historic-port-and-riverwalk/6764/\">riverwalk</a>. Winnipeg is famous for the <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/river-trail\">skating trail</a> in the winter, which is among the longest in Canada, but you don’t need to wait for the ice to freeze to enjoy the sights. The river trail is a beautiful, accessible path that winds alongside our river. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the path as it stretches through <a href=\"https://www.osbornevillage.com/\">Osborne Village</a> and surrounds The Forks. It’s a gorgeous choice for a weekend stroll, and practical enough for your daily commute!</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9Mei2jg8C/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Check out <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/fitnessinthepark/\">Fitness in the Park</a> this summer.</p>\n<h3>Watch a Movie on Memorial</h3>\n<p>Looking for something outdoorsy but with a little less&#8230;moving? Sit back and relax with <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/movies-on-memorial/\">Movies on Memorial</a> this summer at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Memorial+provincial+park/@49.8832967,-97.1610086,14z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smemorial+park!3m4!1s0x0:0x6c1f4758bc336034!8m2!3d49.8866164!4d-97.1485806\">Memorial Park</a>.

Sit down dining not really your thing? Check out downtown <a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/eat-and-drink/peg-city-grub/read,post/881/2019-winnipeg-food-truck-guide\">Winnipeg’s many food trucks</a> this summer! With a surprising amount of variety and high-quality dishes, it’ll make you rethink street food. Don’t forget to check back at the end of summer for the <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/events/food-truck-wars/\">Manyfest</a> (Food Truck Wars). This year’s competition runs from September 6 to 8, which is arguably the end of the food truck season for Winnipeg.</p>\n<h3>Soak up the Arts in the Exchange District</h3>\n<p><strong>Reggae Fest</strong><br />\nIn July, Winnipeg hosts the Winnipeg <a href=\"https://srfwpg.blogspot.com/\">Soca Reggae Festival</a>. This is one for your summer to-do list for sure! Catch the festival downtown at Winnipeg favourite, <a href=\"https://exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/\">The Cube Stage</a>. Reggae Fest is just one of many unique festivals that happens in the Exchange District every summer.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fringe Festival</strong><br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfringe.com/\">Fringe Festival</a> takes over the Exchange District every summer.

Between the throbbing nightclubs and laid-back bars, you’re bound to have a great time anywhere you go. In a city so full of live music and things to do, it can be hard to choose where to go⁠—but The Good Will Social Club and Forth Café are two of my favourites.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://thegoodwill.ca/\">The Good Will Social Club</a></h3>\n<p>The Good Will is located at 625 Portage Avenue, near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. At first glance, it looks like an okay option to stop for a beer, and you’d be right⁠—but it’s so much more than that! The Good Will often features DJs, bands, and karaoke. Once upon a time, I took part in a spelling “beer” there! Check out their online calendar to see what they’ve got going on.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">Forth Café</a></h3>\n<p>During the day this charming café at 171 McDermot Avenue is a great place for coffee and cocktails. However, this café has a not-so-secret secret: an intimate bar downstairs and a roof-top patio with views of the Exchange. The café closes at 10:00 pm during the week, but the bar and roof-top patio are <a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">open late</a>.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwR7W2UAyqU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I moved into my first apartment as a teenager with my parents to save money, but there were many reasons why I stuck with apartments for so long.</p>\n<h3>Location, location, location</h3>\n<p>I’ve lived in multiple cities and provinces, and my biggest reason for sticking with apartment living was always location and the convenience it brought. I’m not a driver, so I like to be in or near downtown areas where buses are plentiful and I can walk to lots of places. I spent years being able to walk to work in less than 20 minutes, and I loved it. Walking is cheap, lets you avoid rush-hour frustration, and is an easy way to get exercise outdoors. (And yes, I still walked to work in Winnipeg winters. The trick is bundling up properly, and I’ll take that over +30℃ weather any day.)</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5d5WBZSPDD\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/\">Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/embed/#?secret=5d5WBZSPDD\" data-secret=\"5d5WBZSPDD\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>It was also nice to be able to walk to the grocery store, coffee shops, and restaurants. Going to a concert downtown? No problem. I strolled right past the line-ups of cars trying to leave the venue. I was often home before most cars had been able to move two blocks. And when I lived in Osborne Village, I had several friends who lived in the neighbourhood, so get-togethers were a cinch.</p>\n<h3>Not handy? No problem</h3>\n<p>Another thing I loved about apartment living was not worrying about upkeep. I am the opposite of handy, so it helped that the most I ever had to do was reset a breaker. If something broke, such as the air conditioner or stove, I didn’t have to fix it or pay to replace it. I also never had to cut grass or shovel snow. I truly miss my shoveling-free days.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"k2InmGbGll\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you/\">Rent vs Buy: Which is Right For You?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you/embed/#?secret=k2InmGbGll\" data-secret=\"k2InmGbGll\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Rent vs Buy: Which is Right For You?&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Community atmosphere</h3>\n<p>I also liked the safety and sense of community I felt in an apartment building. I didn’t always know my neighbours, but sometimes I made friends and it was nice to have people to say “hello” to on my way in or out. Being a single woman for many of those years, I always felt safer in a secure building with neighbours within earshot. Being alone at night in a house (particularly if it was a large house) always brought out the worst in my imagination.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"56Cpvm1R18\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/new-to-networking-start-with-your-neighbours/\">New to Networking?

Start With Your Neighbours!&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Nice and easy</h3>\n<p>I’ve done quite a lot of moving around, and apartments were ideal for that too. I never had to worry about selling a house or what the market was like when it came time to move. I just gave my necessary notice and was off.</p>\n<p>I’ve always liked having a smaller place, too. (Even my house is small.) I like not having to furnish lots of rooms, and more importantly, I hate having to clean a big place. I could clean any of my apartments in less than an hour, so I didn’t waste my precious time on dreaded housework.</p>\n<h3>The one downside</h3>\n<p>My only beef about some of my apartments (always the older buildings) was when I had no control over the heat in winter. Those apartments were always too warm for my liking. In my last apartment, butter would half-melt on the counter because it was so hot! For this reason, I recommend looking for a relatively new building where you can control your own thermostat.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p><strong>Overall, there’s so much to like about apartment living that I’m surprised more people don’t try it. They’re missing out! What’s your favourite aspect of apartment living?</strong></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I spent almost 20 years living in apartments before moving into a house, and they were good years.

The project’s ambitions were to connect local gardeners and to help new relationships “blossom”.</p>\n<p>When I first saw the piece, I was in awe of Erica’s ability to create something that felt so familiar. Living rooms are places of comfort, where we gather with friends and family; they’re filled with memories of holidays, parties and cuddling up to watch your favourite tv shows. Building something that feels so homey encourages people to feel welcomed. I think that sense of togetherness probably made more people want to participate in up-keeping the community gardens where Erica built her creations.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5754\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5754\" style=\"width: 720px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/living-living-room\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5754\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478.jpg\" alt=\"Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478.jpg 720w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-500x332.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Garden Bus Tour, West Broadway, living living room by Erica Swendrowski — Photo by Robert Tinker</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I also appreciate the creative relationship between the traditionally-shaped living room “furniture” and the earthy materials and tones. As a place to spend time together, living rooms are a central part of our homes.

Here are some of my favourite ways to use my space!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5630\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Small kitchen, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments, Kitchen Interiors, Kitchen Clutter, Kitchen utensils\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>1. Stacking</h3>\n<p>Stacking is your best friend with a tiny kitchen. My kitchen is what some might call an organized mess. As soon as you walk into my space, you’re greeted by my microwave underneath my coffee maker, which is tucked up against my slow cooker, which has three cookbooks stacked neatly on top. Small kitchens usually don’t have room for much horizontal space, but what about vertical space? Start by stacking items that you don’t tend to grab as much, and then stack items that you frequently use together. Not only will you save space, but you’ll also know which stack to pull things from when you’re in a time crunch rather than running around trying to find your food processer or a cookbook.</p>\n<h3>2. Clean as You Go</h3>\n<p>Cleaning as you go is a crucial habit for cooking in a small space. You cannot use your space to its fullest potential with pots and food scrapes taking over half of your counter space! This tip is basic, but a total game changer.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1497982703677591&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"573\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3>3. Use ALL Your Space</h3>\n<p>Utilizing all your space is also a key component to enlarging your kitchen. Try placing a cutting board over your stove top or an open drawer. Use your kitchen table as a prep space or place one of your larger cutting boards over your sink to make extra counter space. Get creative. Just because it isn’t a countertop doesn’t mean it can’t function like one!</p>\n<h3>4. Look Up for Utensil Storage</h3>\n<p>Store your utensils up high! I’m very particular about where my utensils go. I recommend that anyone who does a lot of cooking in a small kitchen store their most used utensils, pots, and pans on hooks. If possible, a shallow cubby is a great space to store utensils. I find it very stressful to rifle through drawers in search of my whisk or a medium frying pan. By displaying a few of your most crucial cooking tools, you set yourself up for success!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1510041235805071&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"491\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><em>Kitchen Appliances I Can Vouch For</em></h3>\n<p>Every birthday and holiday, it seems like a new kitchen appliance is at the top of my list! Here are some of my favourite kitchen appliances that are a must for those of us with limited space.</p>\n<p><strong>Mini Food Processor</strong></p>\n<p>A mini food processor is an essential! Not only is this contraption small, but it’s also a great tool for chopping up food quickly. It saves you so much counter space over clunky cutting boards.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow Cooker</strong></p>\n<p>Slow cookers solve all our problems, honestly. They’re a necessity for those who dread coming home and cooking dinner after their 9-to-5. Just pop in your ingredients in the morning, leave it for the day and boom, a hot meal to welcome you home!</p>\n<p><strong>Coffee Maker</strong></p>\n<p>A good ol’ coffee maker is a must for us downtowners—it’s just a way of life! I have both a coffee maker and an espresso maker, but coffee for me is a lifestyle more than a drink. I think a standard coffee maker is a necessity for all kitchens. Nowadays, they’re so compact they don’t take up much room in your kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>Rolling Cart</strong></p>\n<p>While not exactly an appliance, a rolling cart is life-changing! I bought mine from Ikea for $35, but the amount of use I get out of it makes it priceless in my book. I mainly use it to store ingredients and utensils that I need while cooking but don’t have the counter space for. The best part is, once I am done with it I can roll it into a corner and it’s out of my way!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Got any other small kitchen tips and tricks?

It’s also known for its selection of unique, classy coffee shops. Downtown coffee shops don’t just serve espresso drinks to get you through the day; they also offer a cozy, relaxing place to unwind.</p>\n<p>I’ve explored coffee shops in downtown Winnipeg from Main Street to Broadway, proving there are many satisfying options for holding meetings, working, chatting, or just spending quality time alone with a good book. When people ask me what to do in Winnipeg or where they can grab a good cup of coffee, I say two magic words: <em>Forth</em> and <em>Parlour</em>. Of course, those are just the highlights⁠—here are five options for where to get your caffeine fix downtown.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools &amp; Horses </a></h3>\n<p>This coffee shop is located at 379 Broadway (plus another location at the Forks), and you can imagine how busy it gets. During the lunch rush, you’re lucky if you manage to snag a seat. To keep pace, the staff is very energetic and friendly. I won’t bother mentioning that they have great coffee⁠—obviously they do, or this place wouldn’t be on the list! Instead, I want to highlight the interior. My forever-favourite part about Fools and Horses is the humongous wooden table right in the middle of the shop. The table is surrounded by mint and silver iron chairs, which are usually filled with students. I can’t count how many random but totally pleasant chats I’ve while sitting there, sipping a delicious cappuccino.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffoolswpg%2Fposts%2F882303228629504&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"604\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://parlourcoffee.ca/\">Parlour</a></h3>\n<p>The first thing that literally hit my eye when I walked into tiny Parlour was the writing on the wall. <em>“No Wi-Fi. Talk to your neighbour.”</em> I was amazed to see my own philosophy of old-fashioned communication reflected in a coffee shop. That day, I got a cup of hot chocolate, a croissant, and walked out having decided to become a regular customer at 468 Main Street. The shop itself is small, but very cozy. They don’t have the usual tables and chairs, just wooden bar chairs and counters lining the walls and window. Grab a spot by the window for the best view of Main Street. Thanks to their friendly baristas, welcoming atmosphere and high-quality coffee, you’ll find an impeccable place to hide from the rain with a good book or for a chat with a stranger.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fparlourcoffee%2Fposts%2F2492837500767216%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"490\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/\">Thom Bargen</a></h3>\n<p>Thom Bargen has two locations in Winnipeg, but I love the café at 250 Kennedy Street. Thom Bargen is the only place in Winnipeg that serves <a href=\"https://philsebastian.com/\">Phil &amp; Sebastian coffee</a> beans. If you’re a coffee lover like myself, you’ll appreciate the selection Thom Bargen offers. They also feature special guest roasters that change monthly. My favourites so far have been Monogram and Anchored.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDowntownPeggy%2Fposts%2F2500409343313725&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"681\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center>Thom Bargen is also known for its beautiful tiny marble tables, and prime location in a beautiful part of downtown. The café is framed by the <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> on one side, and a small bookshop that has a huge selection of old and rare editions on the other. The Kennedy location also has the most Instagram-worthy plant wall! It makes the café feel fresh and summery on even the coldest days.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.stellas.ca/\">Stella’s</a></h3>\n<p>While not technically a coffee shop, Stella’s deserves a mention when discussing coffee in downtown Winnipeg. The Stella’s location at 110 Sherbrook is a <a href=\"https://www.stellas.ca/bakery/\">bakery</a>-plus-restaurant combo across two buildings. While I highly recommend the restaurant for breakfast or lunch, today I want to highlight the bakery. Step inside, take in a breath of air warm with freshly baked bread, order a latte and chocolate croissant, and nestle in at one of the tiny wooden tables in the corner. The bakery feels meant for quiet conversations or a quick getaway from responsibilities. A word of advice: When hunting for a chocolate croissant, make sure to get there in the morning. The famous pastries at Stella’s fly out the door as soon as they open.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FStellascafebakery%2Fposts%2F2142578272457783%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"614\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/forth_wpg/\">Forth</a></h3>\n<p>I saved the most unique and loved café for last. Forth is known for its square wooden tables, plants, and stand of newspapers from different cities.

They serve a small menu of snacks, salads, and some alcoholic beverages. The rooftop bar is the most stylish and minimalist-looking bar I’ve seen in Winnipeg. When you visit, indulge in the avocado toast, as it will just melt on your tongue. The shop is in a historical building at 171 McDermot. The <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/dawsonrichardsonbuilding.shtml\">Dawson Richardson Building</a> was built in 1921 to become the Grain Trade News publishing house.

Shake to mix, and then add the Sal Suds and oil. Gently shake the bottle again to combine the ingredients.</p>\n<h3>Homemade Drain Cleaner</h3>\n<p>½ cup baking soda</p>\n<p>¼ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>Sprinkle baking soda down the clogged or smelly drain, then pour in the vinegar. Let the bubbling mixture sit for an hour or so, then pour boiling hot water down the drain to rinse. Depending on how clogged the drain is, you may need to repeat the process.

Add the dish soap, put the lid on, gently shake and you are ready to clean!

Add the vinegar and the baking soda to the toilet next (without stirring or scrubbing) and wait until the mixture stops bubbling. Scrub any tough stains, otherwise just flush and you’re done! The soda and the vinegar/baking-soda mixture will also help to keep the pipes clear of buildup.</p>\n<p><em><strong>But what about carpets or stinky smells that linger around your house?</strong></em></p>\n<h3>Homemade Air Freshener</h3>\n<p>15 drops pure essential oil (grapefruit and lavender are my favourite!)</p>\n<p>½ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>½ cup water</p>\n<p>Combine ingredients in a spray bottle and shake. Spray liberally around your home to freshen things up!</p>\n<h3>Carpet Cleaner</h3>\n<p>1 cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>2 cups water 2 teaspoons salt 15 drops lavender essential oil or another clear, pure essential oil of choice</p>\n<p>Combine vinegar and water in a large spray bottle. Add in salt and lavender essential oil; close the cap and shake bottle. Spray on carpets where needed and allow carpets to air-dry.

Maybe you’re drawn in by the menu, the decor, the service, or a beautiful combination of all three. Or maybe it has that certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca/\">Smith Restaurant</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a> is one of those places.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re enjoying a staycation, a family gathering, or looking for a more intimate <em>rendezvous</em> (yes, even for breakfast), Smith Restaurant should be at the top of your list.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>Country chic. Comfortable. Warm and modern. In a nutshell, Smith’s interior is a blend of styles with something to appeal to everyone. And, given that Smith is a popular spot not only for breakfast but dinner and the after-dinner crowd as well, its appeal transcends the morning hours. Let’s call it <em>Canadiana</em> fusion, with wood features, modern lighting, leather and benches covered in <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> point blankets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5361\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5361\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast, Smith Restaurant, Inn at The Forks, The Forks, Meet Me At The Forks, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Living Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg Restaurants, Where To Eat Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside the Smith Restaurant</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>The service</h3>\n<p>Professional and yet personable fits the service to a tee. From the host, who was unfazed when we showed up early for our reservation, to our server Angela, with whom we shared a few good laughs. The service matched the situation and exceeded our expectations.</p>\n<h3>The menu</h3>\n<p>“Not your mama’s eggs” comes to mind when describing the menu. Not that there is anything wrong with her eggs, but Smith’s chefs have succeeded in creating a menu that features local, seasonal, and Canadian products, which really bumps those eggs up to the next level. Sure, you can order the Hotel Breakfast—which consists of some good old-fashioned eggs with a choice of bacon or sausage—or oatmeal (with a Saskatoon berry twist), but there are a few more interesting options.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbGNNzgKD6/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It might be the Scandinavian blood in me, but the Eggs Copenhagen called, and I was not disappointed. Two poached eggs with smoked lox and rösti potato came together nicely. Of course, no breakfast would be complete without a good cup of tea or coffee, and here, too, we pleasantly surprised.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual selection of teas, cappuccino, espresso, and Americano coffees, Smith offers a French press coffee option. We gave the French press a try, and it was exquisite.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to kick off your day with some good food, give Smith a try. Perhaps you, too, will find that it has that <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<p>Feedback on <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154954-d7078344-Reviews-Smith_Restaurant-Winnipeg_Manitoba.html\">TripAdvisor rates Smith a four out of five</a> with “value” having the lowest rating.

Classes usually run Monday to Friday from 12 to 1 pm. Visit the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/fitnessinthepark/\">Downtown Biz website</a> for details and an up-to-date schedule. These classes are free; just bring your yoga mat!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbwpg.cmha.ca/events/free-yoga-and-meditation-tuesdays-and-thursdays-2019-06-25/\"><strong>Yoga and meditation with Cian</strong></a><br />\n930 Portage Avenue</p>\n<p>Every Tuesday from 6 to 7 pm, Cian—a trained yogi—hosts a free yoga and meditation session for Winnipeggers of all levels of experience. The event is first come, first serve with only 20 spots available, so show up early to grab a spot!</p>\n<p><strong><em>My recommendation</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you’re not a fan of group classes, or just want to get your yogi on solo, downtown Winnipeg has beautiful parks where you can lay out your mat. One of my favourite quiet places is <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/business/stephen-juba-park/\">Stephen Juba Park</a>, right waterfront in the Exchange district. If you are looking for a quieter yoga session, try going early in the morning.</p>\n<h3>Where can I find a few minutes of silence?</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re looking for a peaceful place to study or somewhere quiet to relax, downtown Winnipeg has got your back!</p>\n<p><strong>Millennium Library<br />\n</strong>251 Donald Street</p>\n<p>A library is the most obvious place to look when craving a bit of silence, but the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/branchpages/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library</a> stands out among Winnipeg’s libraries. Spread on each side of a massive staircase, the study area is a designated “quiet zone.” At any point in the day, you’ll find people working in complete silence. This area is also beautiful, with simple design that won’t distract you from your work and enormous windows that stand from floor to ceiling. Natural light fills the area and it’s a wonderful place to find a few moments of peace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/leg-lib/\"><strong>Legislative Library</strong></a><br />\n200 Vaughan Street</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BjgRSZElbTB/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Deciding to add a dog to your family is a big commitment, but the joy a canine companion brings can’t be beat. You’re probably wondering: <em>How do I choose the right dog for my apartment?</em> Is it a question of size? Activity level? Or something else? The answer may surprise you!</p>\n<p>But before we head off to explore how to choose the right dog, there is some inner soul searching that needs to happen. You need to be honest with yourself about your lifestyle and what motivates your choices. You must first “know thyself” in order to find a good match, so that’s where we’ll begin!</p>\n<h3>The soul-searching basics</h3>\n<p>Whether you are considering a move downtown or are already there, ask yourself a few lifestyle questions first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What prompted the move?</li>\n<li>What drew you to the downtown life? To apartment life?</li>\n<li>What stage of life are you in? Career building? Retired? Somewhere in between?</li>\n<li>Do you like to travel? And if so, how often?</li>\n<li>How active are you? Are you a runner, hiker, or couch potato?</li>\n<li>Why do you want a dog?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5002\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HIking-2-1024x739.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking with a dog, active lifestyle, apartment dog, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"739\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-1024x739.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-770x556.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-500x361.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2.jpg 1052w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>There are no wrong answers. Rather, the intent is to identify which aspects of your life are the most important and then determine how Moe will fit in.</p>\n<p>Did I forget to mention that I’ve already named your future dog?</p>\n<p>As for how active you are, I am not going to say that as a runner, a Shih Tzu or other small dog is out of the question or that as a couch potato, you shouldn’t consider a lab mix or Standard Poodle. Not at all. While the journey to find the right dog begins with you, once Moe comes home, it’s no longer just about you. Every dog will have needs that must be met—especially when it comes to expending energy—otherwise you may find yourself in a very unhappy, unhealthy relationship.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwmcR-3gUty/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Talk with your family, friends and dog owners. Online, you can find countless articles and sites that might be useful on your quest, but here are four to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.winnipeghumanesociety.ca/adopt/before-you-adopt/are-you-ready-for-a-dog/\">Winnipeg Humane Society: “Are you ready for a dog?”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ckc.ca/en/Choosing-a-Dog\">Canadian Kennel Club: “Choosing a Dog”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dogtime.com/matchup\">DogTime’s Dog Matchup tool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hillspet.ca/en-ca/dog-care/behavior-appearance/choosing-the-best-dog-breed-personality\">Hills Pet Nutrition: “Dog Breed Personalities: Find the Right Match For You”</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now begins life with Moe.</p>\n<h3>A tired dog is a good dog</h3>\n<p>Pet store staff can give you recommendations on how to entertain Moe with everything from chews to toys. And if burning off energy at the dog park is in his future, a ball or frisbee might be worth considering. For running and hiking, a comfortable and well-sized harness is a good investment; you can even purchase a comfortable doggy seatbelt for road trips.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5000\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5000\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3366-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Dog in a car seat, dog seatbelt, dog harness, apartment dog, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366.jpg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winston, Pug, 1</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>And yes, a bed, for those moments when Moe has finally run out of steam.</p>\n<p>It’s not so much the size of the dog that matters when it comes to apartment living but its excitability, tendency to bark and ability to adapt to smaller spaces. Remember that you are living in a community, and Moe needs to walk the hallways, meet your neighbours, and take the elevator when he’s not lounging in your apartment.</p>\n<p>Invest some time in training Moe to be a great canine neighbour. Yes, there is work involved but, it is well worth it. Both you and Moe will be thankful for having done it.</p>\n<h3>Green spaces and dog-friendly parks</h3>\n<p>Winnipeg has many green spaces and trails within a short distance from the downtown core. From Waterfront Drive and <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> to <a href=\"https://www.assiniboinepark.ca/\">Assiniboine Park</a>, you and Moe have plenty of options to get out and explore!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1477463672396161&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"510\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center>The city operates 11 off-leash dog parks, one of which is right downtown.

Visit the city of Winnipeg website for a <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/parksOpenSpace/OffLeashDogParks/default.stm\">list of all off-leash dog areas</a>.</p>\n<h3>There’s no love like the love of a dog</h3>\n<p>As a dog owner myself, much of what I’ve said comes from personal experience. I could probably write a book about life with my pets over the years. Brandy (since passed away), a Shih Tzu, explored the eastern states from the green mountains of Vermont to the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts in a pink stroller because she didn’t like to walk. Alice, our Standard Poodle and an aspiring writer, is busy putting together her own coffee table book of decorating accomplishments. Alice and I can often be found at the Charleswood dog park with Winnie, a Bearded Collie. Woof, woof!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Have any questions about living the apartment life with your furry friend?

Quite honestly, downtown is the only neighbourhood that really captures the magic of Winnipeg while sidestepping any of the inconveniences, and <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a> snagged the perfect spot.</p>\n<h3>Winnipeg: Chicago of the North!</h3>\n<p>By now we’re all familiar with Winnipeg’s claim to fame but unfortunately, people are starting to wonder if that’s still relevant. I&#8217;m here to tell you why that reputation is more relevant than ever, and why you want to be at <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a>, the building to kick it all off!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; margin: 10px 0 0 0; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1415526985256497&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"611\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center>Chicago is a little bit ahead of us architecturally, aren’t they? The good news is, Winnipeg’s architects seem eager to catch up—and quick. The city’s center is rapidly expanding, and Winnipeggers are determined to show their southern sister that the cold doesn’t slow us down!</p>\n<p>You just can&#8217;t beat the convenience of living at <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a>, right at the underground mall that connects all the way down to <a href=\"https://portageplace.ca/\">Portage Place</a> via the skywalk system. You’ll never have to bear that true north wind, from your apartment door to your seat for the game at <a href=\"https://www.bellmtsplace.ca/\">BellMTS Place</a>. Just steps away, <a href=\"https://www.cityplacewinnipeg.com/\">City Place</a> is full of food, convenience stores, a liquor mart, and an indoor farmers market; it even connects to Winnipeg&#8217;s famous <a href=\"https://www.sharkclub.com/\">Shark Club</a> for an affordable lunch special and maybe the occasional hand of cards between laundry flips.</p>\n<p>But if the skywalk system to <a href=\"https://portageplace.ca/\">Portage Place Mall</a> isn’t long enough, almost every main bus route in the city connects within a block from your front door.

However, this is one of my favourite cafés in downtown Winnipeg as they are always willing to adapt their dishes to meet your needs. Plus, whether you’re vegan or just want to see what all the fuss is about almond milk, Clementine has your back with a wide variety of milk alternatives!</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BaY75zGACId/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Interior design trends tend to parallel fashion. The beautiful difference between modern fashion and the styles of the 20s and 70s (years that <a href=\"https://www.chanel.com/en_CA/\"><em>Chanel</em></a> marked the most in fashion history) is that now we mix different styles that seem to have nothing in common. Being able to adapt old, mix it with new, and add elements that reflect your true self is living fashionably.</p>\n<p>When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing. If someone tries to guess why everything around your house looks so special—let them guess. The secret is as simple as Scandinavian minimalist: mix it all. Here are 5 things you need to know to get started.</p>\n<h3>1. Do your research</h3>\n<p>Perhaps you’re at the threshold, about to refurnish your apartment or just moved into a new place. Either way, the question running through your mind is the same: “How do I make my home nicer, fashionable or just refreshing?”</p>\n<p>At this stage, you might already have an idea of how you want your place to look. But in the worst-case scenario, you can’t even imagine; just picking a color for your new couch sounds about as fun as a polar bear dip. Either way, a little research will get your home makeover off to the right start!</p>\n<p>If you already know what you crave, research will give you fresh ideas and inspiration. It will open up new horizons, help you make decisions, and narrow down your preferences to one or two major styles.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example: we all like different things. Ask my husband and I what we think about mid-century nightstands, and you’ll hear a lot of arguments. Mid-century nightstands are the only thing we couldn’t agree on when furnishing our bedroom. In situations like this, doing a bit of research can uncover new ideas, compromises, and inspiration.</p>\n<p>I suggest <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.ca/\">Pinterest</a> (of course!), interior design books—for a general feel—and movies. Inspiration can come from anywhere! We’re all drawn to certain items and materials that reflect our interests, preferences, and dreams. The key to décor that you love is to listen to that voice inside you that reacts immediately during the research phase.</p>\n<h3>2. Modern design</h3>\n<p>Modern design is hard to define exactly. It reflects modern art and features the best of minimalism, sophistication, and elegance. Modern interior design is also known for its focus on practicality and usefulness. Every piece in a modern apartment should be useful, rather than artsy and architectural.</p>\n<p>Simple lines. Neutral tones. Earthy colors. Open space. That’s the core of modern interior design. This aesthetic has its roots in Scandinavian and German architecture and features more colourful accents than true minimalism does (we’ll get to that later).</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4686\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4686\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4686\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Design, Living Room, Home Decor, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Luxury Apartment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4686\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From tianya1223 on Pixabay</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The open areas, minimalistic and airy aesthetic in modern design has one big disadvantage: It can feel like an office. If you decide to go for a modern look, avoid the strictness and simplicity that is inherent to office space. Focus on details to keep your apartment feeling warm and comfortable. Sentimental photographs of your cat, colourful paintings, wool-textured blankets on the couch, and a few vintage candle holders keep a modern simple space looking cozy and welcoming.</p>\n<h3>3. Vintage interior design</h3>\n<p>Romantic, elegant and as cozy as grandma’s house: that’s vintage interior design. Vintage décor creates a feeling of nostalgia through old-fashioned style furniture and lots of texture in pillows, blankets, vases, and paintings. Details like scratches and scrapes on furniture are essential! I suggest visiting your grandparents and asking for that old, scratched-up dresser to make it a statement piece in your bedroom.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4688\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4688\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4688\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg 237w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-770x975.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-809x1024.jpg 809w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-500x633.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-293x371.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-1400x1773.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4688\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4689\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4689\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4689\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>As cozy as vintage can be, it’s important to achieve balance between old and new. It would be easy to go to a flea market and buy a set of furniture, floral wallpaper, a record player, and call it a day; the danger is that your space might end up looking bulky and copied. It might look and feel like living in an old movie. This is where balance comes in: Use antiques and vintage finds as accents.</p>\n<p>Beside a modern grey couch, place an antique blush pink sofa chair. Instead of floral wallpaper, paint your walls grey or white and hang vintage photographs or oil paintings. Definitely show off your record player and vases, but use them sparingly! No one wants to feel like they live in a museum of a thrift store.</p>\n<h3>4. Minimalist</h3>\n<p>Neutral tones. White. Lots of white. Greenery. Wooden furniture. Wooden details. Nothing extra. Nothing extravagant. Minimalist interior design takes its cues from Scandinavia and had a huge influence on Western countries in the early 90s.</p>\n<p>Minimalism is great for making small spaces look bigger thanks to light tones and minimal furniture. Some might call minimalist design boring, but I call it clean and intellectual. It’s like thinking “clean” and getting rid of things that are not necessary—in your life and in your apartment.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4691\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4691\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Minimalist, Minimalism, Scandinavian Design, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-770x1153.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-500x749.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-293x439.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-1400x2097.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Alexandra Gorn from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Think simple lines, linen textures, and light color palettes when decorating your apartment like a minimalist. To void an empty, clinic-like feeling, add unexpected details. A painting by a young, unknown artist? Great choice! It shows off your personality and passion for art. Wooden side table with a funky architectural shape? Go for it, and make it the highlight of the room.</p>\n<p>Minimalism is all about quality, not quantity, and “less is more” is the rule. Combine sophisticated furniture with clean lines with small, meaningful things—like that quirky painting—to make your place feel special, while still keeping things simple.</p>\n<h3>5. Mixing and matching</h3>\n<p>Mixing-and-matching is its own trend, complete with rules and suggestions for mixing and matching different styles. The first rule that applies in mixing styles is to express yourself boldly, but—there’s always a but—don’t go crazy and overload the space. Choose a theme (like any of the styles above) and stick to that idea to create an overall feel. Then, go and have some fun!</p>\n<p>Mix old wooden chairs with colourful metal chairs around the kitchen table. Get brightly-patterned dishes and mix them with minimalistic white dishes. Hang linen curtains and throw plaid wool blankets on the couch. The possibilities are endless!</p>\n<p>The beauty of mixing and matching is in an artsy composition. First, you create a background; I personally love light grey and white walls. Then, you can start throwing splashes of colours. Select two or three colours that work together, and use them as main accents when getting pillows, paintings and coffee mugs.</p>\n<p>My own place is a mix of vintage and minimalist styles. I have piles of old books scattered around, paintings, black-white photographs, and a yellow 50s-style couch. I use simple wooden, grey, or white furniture as a background that I can add color to. Pillows and blankets are my two favourite accents that I can change depending on the season and my mood. While I stick to neutral colours in general, drops of colours are seen in details like bohemian dishware, my blue office chair, and colourful and light wooden photo frames.</p>\n<p>Furnishing an apartment should feel exciting and fun! You just need some patience to find those special pieces, loving eyes, time, and a will to create an outstanding space around yourself.</p>\n<p><em>So which side are you on—mixing and matching, or sticking to one style throughout?</em></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing.

Start With Your Neighbours!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Networking—a fancy term for a simple idea. Meet people, interact with them and build new relationships. We’re so used to networking through social media that the thought of physically interacting with people might sound a little bit alien. You could have 300 people on your <a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> network, another 300 on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>, and not know any of them well enough to know where they are from. Friendly relations between neighbours encourages real-life networking, and as old school as it may sound, it’s so valuable. Everyone has a story to tell, and you would probably miss the most interesting chapters if you had the same conversation online.</p>\n<p>Humans are social by nature; we need to have meaningful conversations with other people to satisfy our natural instinct to know one another. Community meet-ups and common areas encourage networking with those around us. Networking doesn’t necessarily mean meeting with influential people who can help you professionally; it can also include people you can really connect with on an intellectual level. Many apartment buildings have common areas so people can lounge and get to know each other. Events like BBQs, pool parties, breakfasts and evening tea encourage tenants to get familiar with each other. While these events may seem like just a casual breakfast (free food!), they’re also opportunities to discuss concerns and get valuable information. For example, downtown apartment dwellers might be happy to learn about the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/safety/watch-ambassadors/\">Downtown Watch Ambassadors</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwK8cMVg5YP/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwK8cMVg5YP/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-04-12T21:43:42+00:00\">Apr 12, 2019 at 2:43pm PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></center></p>\n<p>Networking isn’t just about advancing your career; it’s also about bonds between neighbours, an important part of apartment living. Being on good terms with your neighbours means you have someone to turn to in case of an emergency, or just to call over for a cup of tea if you’re having a bad day and need someone to talk to. You can surround yourself with people you trust who can eventually become part of your support system. Good neighbours can end up feeling like family when you’re living alone.</p>\n<p>The great thing about downtown Winnipeg is the strong sense of community that the area promotes. Most apartment buildings are designed to have spaces for general use. Downtown boasts wonderful cultural diversity, making networking even more fun! You can get to know people from varied backgrounds, find out first-hand details about other cultures, and learn about entirely different ways of life.</p>\n<p>My apartment building used to have the best BBQ parties for tenants where we would all just chat; it was fun to find out that I had a police officer and ballet dancer living on the same floor as me. At one BBQ, I saw a distinguished-looking gentleman hand over his business card to a student looking for an internship. It felt so good to be living in a community where people were looking out for each other and helping out where they could. These meet-ups can even help recent immigrants build their social circles and meet new people.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4665 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/alexis-brown-85793-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"New to Networking?

And I promise you, you can do it. Let’s look at your options.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en\">Winnipeg Transit</a></h3>\n<p>You can ride the good ol’ bus to move around our city. The service isn’t great from some outlying suburban areas, but you can reach most everywhere by bus. And it’s easy to figure out, too. There’s a Winnipeg Transit app you can download onto your phone. You can also use the Winnipeg Transit <a href=\"https://m.winnipegtransit.com/navigo\">Navigo website</a>.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4648\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4648\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4648\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2416-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Transit, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-100x100.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-770x770.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-293x293.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-390x390.jpg 390w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-585x585.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-900x900.jpg 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-1400x1400.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4648\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Very Canadian</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>With either version, you enter your departing address, your destination, and the time you need to arrive or leave. Navigo will then show you all your options to get where you are going, including walking time and time between transfers. You can also monitor a particular stop if you want to see when buses will arrive. The app/website shows where buses are in real time by tracking the fleet with GPS. This takes the guesswork out of knowing when your bus will arrive, which is particularly helpful on nasty weather days. The city could do better with transit, and we need more rapid transit routes, but this is one way you can get around Winnipeg.</p>\n<p>If you need to get around downtown, you can hop aboard one of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit buses</a>. They take a couple of different routes through the downtown area. The best part? <strong>The Downtown Spirit is always free!</strong></p>\n<h3>Your Bike</h3>\n<p>If you want to stay in shape and avoid all carbon emissions, cycling might be the way to go. And yes, you can cycle here year-round. (At least if you’re the hardy type.) The advent of fat bike tires can help you with winter cycling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center></center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbiIIHEBsQ_/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbiIIHEBsQ_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Winnipeg, we never put our bikes away&#8230; we just let some air out of the tires and go about our day!! . . . #canon60D #donsaction #Winnipeg #exploremb #explorecanada #artofvisuals #visualsgang #royalsnappingartist #way2ill #gramslayers #cityscape #paradisecanada #TrailsManitoba #exploreeverything #onlyinthepeg #allthingswinnipeg #visualscollective #world_great #discoverearth #discoverglobe #imagesofcanada #tourcanada #paradisecanada #moodygrams #agameoftones #vscogram #visualambassadors #visualcreators #canadagram #winteriscoming</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshuaa_blade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Josh</a> (@joshuaa_blade) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-11-15T22:49:05+00:00\">Nov 15, 2017 at 2:49pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>While you can cycle all city streets in Winnipeg, not everyone loves sharing the road with larger, faster moving cars. The city does have a series of dedicated bike routes, including downtown bike lanes. If you aren’t sure where to find these, the city provides a number of <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/pedestriansCycling/maps/default.stm\">bike maps to help you plan your trip</a>.</p>\n<p>Biking is a great way to see Winnipeg, particularly many of our downtown parks and pretty spaces!</p>\n<h3>Your Feet</h3>\n<p>Another great way to get in your daily exercise and protect the environment is by simply using your feet to move you from point A to point B. I used to live in <a href=\"https://www.osbornevillage.com/\">Osborne Village</a> and walked to work downtown every day, even in -35 degree weather.</p>\n<p>You can’t walk everywhere, but consider walking for your shorter trips. You will need good shoes (or good winter boots with grip) to stay comfortable, but those are far cheaper than a car. Wearing a good base layer or snow pants with your coat, hat and mitts can keep you nice and toasty in the winter. You also generate a fair amount of body heat when you’re moving around. Just make sure you invest in good quality gear; the super-cheap stuff might leave you too cold or too sweaty under your coat.</p>\n<p>Walking is great for your health, as is spending time outdoors in general. It can be difficult to walk down sidewalks in winter before the plows come up, but you can use the street instead (in residential areas). Or, you could truly embrace our winters and pull out your snowshoes!</p>\n<p>Downtown is a great place to walk, particularly around <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/jubapark.shtml\">Stephen Juba Park</a>. You will find many pretty things to see as you promenade along the water. In the winter, you can walk on the Red or Assiniboine and see all of the delightful <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts near the Forks</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.tappcar.com/\">Tapp Car</a></h3>\n<p>There might be times when you need to get somewhere that isn’t easily accessible except by car. You can use our local taxi services, but I quite enjoy Tapp Car, Winnipeg’s answer to <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/ca/en/\">Uber</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/\">Lyft</a>. We have a few other rideshare services in the city, but I can only vouch for Tapp Car, which was the first player here.</p>\n<p>They have an easy-to-use app that shows how long it will take your car to get to you, and shows the car make, model, colour and license plate, along with your driver’s name. This is nice to know for safety reasons. The cars are always clean, and the drivers are generally friendly. You set up payment directly in the app, so you don’t have to fuss with cash or a debit machine when you arrive at your destination. You can step out of the car as soon as you’ve arrived.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BftJZrshPAO/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BftJZrshPAO/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Excited?!

Clementine will enchant your taste buds with dishes that burst with flavour, at a price you won’t be mad about.</p>\n<p>Clementine is a true hidden gem in the middle of downtown Winnipeg. Located in the Exchange District at 123 Princess Street, this cozy restaurant is accessible only by a stairwell wedged between a Subway and a bar. Walk too fast, and you just might miss it. You would never guess that hidden behind a plain black door that reads “123” would be a welcoming, intimate restaurant humming with the low voices of diners discussing how tasty their meals are.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4483\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4483\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4483\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Clementine1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Clementine, Breakfast, Eggs Benedict, Exchange District, Shop Local,Cappuccino, Mimosa,Burger Dip, Downtown Living\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4483\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Burger Dip 2.0, Braised Bacon Benedict paired with cappuccino and grapefruit mimosa</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Atmosphere</h3>\n<p>As you descend the stairs, you’ll be met with a neon light sign suggesting, “Eat this, it’ll help.” The sign doesn’t lie, and you won’t be disappointed. A drawback of this otherwise standout restaurant is that it isn’t accessible for folks who depend on a wheelchair or are not able to walk down stairs. Sadly, Clementine is only accessible via a staircase down from street level.</p>\n<p>Warm colours, lights and textures decorate the space, creating a cozy atmosphere that pairs perfectly with a constant buzz of conversation.</p>\n<p>Another neat feature is that the kitchen is in full view, so you can enjoy watching the staff promptly prepare your fresh meal while you sip your cappuccino.</p>\n<h3>The Menu</h3>\n<p>Don’t expect your average all-Canadian breakfasts like any chain restaurant. Clementine’s menu is packed with originality and superb flavors make this restaurant my number-one recommendation for breakfast or lunch.</p>\n<p>Breakfast-brunch-lunch dishes with global influence makes Clementine the “go to” for hipsters, young families, and silver-haired couples alike. Clementine is known for short, but mouth-watering menu. The menu is creative and well-thought out, with an assortment of dishes for every palate.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BiZxVs9BL6Z/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

For instance, enjoy their porridge with mixed grains, coconut, pineapple purée, berries and cashews; or, be transported to Belgium with their perfectly fluffy Brussels Style Waffle (pictured above), topped with roasted berries, caramelized bananas, cinnamon whipped cream and maple syrup. Warning. Your mouth will water.</p>\n<p>If you’re like me and coffee is your main food group, Clementine does not disappoint. Whether you’re looking for an espresso, latte, cappuccino, or—for the truly coffee-savvy—a piccolo, they offer it!</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> If you want to play it safe, Fried Chicken on Toast (trust me!); if you are feeling a bit more adventurous, the Mushroom Chilaquiles is superb!</p>\n<h3>You’re a Guest not a Customer</h3>\n<p>The service is unbeatable, with staff who are warm and attentive. They have no issue offering you or your group suggestions or explanations for their unique menu options. One peek into their bustling kitchen, and you’ll see how hard their team works to provide you with a truly delicious dish!</p>\n<h3>Good to Know</h3>\n<p>Clementine’s one downside is that they are open from 7 am to 3 pm (weekdays) and 8 am to 4 pm (weekends), so your after-work cravings will have to wait! They also get busy fast. If you’re looking for a quick breakfast, I highly recommend arriving before 10 am on the weekends and 9:30 on weekdays. They do not take reservations.</p>\n<p>Clementine is very accommodating to special dietary needs. They offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.</p>\n<p>Dishes range from $6 to $15.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking for a breakfast/brunch/lunch option other than the usual pancakes or basic bacon and eggs?

Whether you’re a die-hard hockey fan or just want to support Winnipeg’s team, the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wpgwhiteout/\">#WinnipegWhiteout</a> gives you a chance to come together and celebrate!</p>\n<h3>What to Expect</h3>\n<p>The energy on the streets during the whiteout is unmatched. There’s something special about half of your city piling onto the streets, decked out in white and the hometown team’s apparel.</p>\n<p>Starting this year, there’s a cover fee of $5.00, but the fun you will have is priceless. All proceeds are going to <a href=\"https://unitedwaywinnipeg.ca/\">The United Way</a>, which will scatter the funds to several organizations in the city helping individuals with mental health and addiction services.</p>\n<p>But that seems to be the only thing that’s changing—seasoned whiteout goers can expect to see the same parties, with huge screens playing the game, local food trucks, beverages (both adult and youth-friendly), snacks, and activities. If you have tots in tow, the alcohol-free family zone at the <a href=\"http://winnipeglibraryfoundation.ca/tour-the-park/\">Millennium Library Park</a> has room for up to 4,000 people!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4185\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Cup, Winnipeg White Out Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Events, Go Jets Go, Winnipeg Jets, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Ice Hockey, Sports, Game Day, #WPGWhiteOut\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Prepare for a Whiteout</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties start exactly 2 hours before each game and the streets get packed fast, so make sure to get there on time if you want to get the full whiteout experience. <a href=\"https://www1.ticketmaster.ca/winnipeg-jets-whiteout-street-party-home-game-2/event/11005682CCE54415\">Buying a ticket</a> doesn’t guarantee you a spot on the street. The street party is capped at 15,000 people for safety reasons (unless you have a ticket to the game).</p>\n<p>From personal experience, I recommend coordinating beforehand if you’re meeting a group of friends. Cell reception can be a bit dodgy and slow with the giant mass amount of people around you, and texting them “I’m by the screen, I’m the one wearing white!” doesn’t exactly work in this situation.</p>\n<p>Don’t have a white Winnipeg Jets jersey? Don’t fret! Every white get-up is welcome, even a basic white tee-shirt. If you’re feeling extra festive, get creative! Grab a white wig, a white tutu, or whatever—there’s no better time to bust out that funky white hat stored in your Halloween costume box.</p>\n<h3>Pack the Essentials</h3>\n<p>Water bottle and a snack: You’re going to spend hours watching the game, chatting with your friends, and just enjoying the hustle and bustle of the party. Stay hydrated and energized by keeping a small snack and a water bottle with you. This also will save you a few bucks!</p>\n<p>Battery Pack: You’re going to want to capture every Instagram-worthy moment, and that is going to drain your phone fast!</p>\n<p>Jacket: As we get further into spring, we Winnipeggers tend to get a bit overconfident about what will be warm enough for us to wear. It may not be that cold at 5 pm when the parties start, but towards the end of the night, you’ll want something to wrap around you. Pack a lightweight jacket (white, obviously) just in case!</p>\n<h3>Get Around Downtown</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties are great for those of us going, but if you can’t make the excitement, navigating around downtown can be torturous! Here are the roads that will be closed during whiteout parties:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economicdevelopmentwinnipeg.com/winnipeg-whiteout/maps-and-resources?camefrom=EMCL_2841648_134922198\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4181 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Whiteout Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Jets, Go Jets Go, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Game Day, Sports, Downtown Living\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-232x300.jpg 232w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-770x996.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-500x647.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-293x379.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-1400x1812.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1.jpg 1700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" /></a></p>\n<p>• Donald between Portage and St. Mary<br />\n• Graham between Hargrave and Smith<br />\n• Smith between Portage and St. Mary</p>\n<p>These streets will be closed from 11:30 a.m. Friday through 6:30 a.m. Saturday for today’s party.</p>\n<h3>Personal Experience</h3>\n<p>My first whiteout was last spring, and as soon as I jumped off the bus onto Graham street, it was if I walked into a different dimension! For as far as my eyes could see, everyone was decked out in white. My nose quickly caught a whiff of the food trucks surrounding me, and my ears were bulldozed with the laughter and chatter of the crowd around me. I followed a mass of people to the center of the street, where hundreds upon hundreds of people were already gathered, getting ready for the game to light up the massive screen in front of us.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be a die-hard fan for the excitement to exist in you. Before experiencing my first whiteout, I enjoyed the occasional hockey game. But as soon as the screen switched on and the first puck hit the ice, I was roaring in unison with the crowd around me. We were loud and proud, screaming the second the Jets hit the ice, singing along to the Canadian anthem, and we kept up that enthusiasm until seconds before the Jets sunk their winning goal at the end of the game. It was like the entire crowd—no, the entire city—was holding its breath. Silence overcame the streets as our eyes were glued to the screen, waiting for the puck to hit net. As soon as it did, we were like a shaken soda bottle—the street exploded in deafening cheers! There must be cracks in the foundations of the buildings around us thanks to the deafening noise the Winnipeggers on the streets were making. I am honestly surprised we didn’t get a noise complaint from our neighboring city. I hugged everyone around me, people I had never seen before—but they felt like long-lost friends.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwGJe-dA0AP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

This can be a great way to save yourself money and cut commuting time, but there are also potential pitfalls!</p>\n<p>I’ve used a home office for my writing and editing business since 2010, so I’m here to help with some tips about working from home and maintaining your sanity.</p>\n<h3>Finding a space to work</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to decide is where in your home you want to work. This can be tricky when space is tight. My first home office was in my downtown apartment. I only had one bedroom, so I couldn’t convert it to office space. I did have a large living room, so I set up my desk and office equipment on one side of it.</p>\n<p>Ensure your spot isn’t too enticing to encroach on. For example, if you have to work in your living room, setting up your desk near the front door might not work out. Your workspace could become a tempting spot to dump your coat, mail or keys when you walk in the door. Try to avoid creating your workspace in a high-traffic area, lest it become a repository for personal junk.</p>\n<p>You also need to consider lighting for your workspace. This is especially important if you’re a creative type and are doing painting, sewing, etc., in your home. Look for a spot near a window for natural sunlight. It also feels good to be able to look up and see the world while you’re hard at work.</p>\n<p>Noise will be another factor when choosing where to work. Some of you may love background noise, such as the radio or other people talking and moving about. I hate it and don’t work well with noise, so I always look for a quiet spot.</p>\n<p>Finally, try to make your space enticing to you. In my current home, we have a second bedroom for my office—but I mostly use it for business storage. I prefer working in my open kitchen at my big wooden table. I like being able to see a lot of things when I look up. If I’m at my desk in my office, I see wall. I learned too late that I should have turned my desk facing into the room instead of putting it against the wall, flanked by two big bookcases, as I don’t like feeling hemmed in while working. The moral of the story is to ensure your workspace makes you happy before you nail a desk to the wall.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4172 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Downtown Apartments, Home office, Renting\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>Having adequate storage for your business items can also be tough in a small space. You might need a big desk, filing cabinets or somewhere to keep your materials and paint. Having worked in many tight spaces, I love Ikea for their storage items because they are particularly skilled at offering goods meant for small spaces. You might have luck finding a smaller desk or storage items that can double as something else.</p>\n<p>I’ve always liked footstools that double as storage boxes. I can keep items hidden away and still have space to rest my weary feet at the end of the day. Shelving that hangs on walls is also helpful. It saves floor space and can provide a nice visual piece in your home if you load it up properly. Look for anywhere you can store things in or under to maximize your use of space.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself if you can store more items electronically, rather than needing filing cabinets for everything. You might also have items you use infrequently and can store offsite or in harder to reach places in your home. I’m prone to towering piles of papers and books, so I need to take more of my own advice.</p>\n<h3>Tax considerations</h3>\n<p>This is the un-fun stuff, but you still need to pay attention. If you work for yourself from home, you can use part of your home expenses, such as rent and hydro, as business write-offs. There is a caveat though: CRA says the space must be used exclusively for your business. If it doubles as personal use, no dice. When I was in my apartment, I couldn’t write off part of my rent because my office was smack in the middle of my living room, which I also used for personal reasons. If you only have one bedroom, you might be in this same bind. Talk to your accountant to see what you can do about making your space eligible for home office deductions.</p>\n<h3>The whole work-life balance thing</h3>\n<p>The other problem to watch out for is the temptation to be working, or thinking about working, all the time. When your home and office are the same place, it can be difficult to pull yourself out of work mode. You can be sitting on your couch watching your favourite show, and something on your desk will catch your eye and try to lure you back to work. This is another reason picking the right work spot is critical. You don’t always want your work to be staring you in the face!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4169 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>You might need to set specific boundaries for work hours to keep you from working day and night. For example, you could choose not to work or answer the phone on weekends or past 6 pm. As you spend more time working at home, you will realize what your trouble spots are, so you can create a plan to overcome them.</p>\n<p>You could also face the opposite problem. When you should be working, your TV or the book you left lying out last night might try to lure you back to leisure. You might need to set specific hours and boundaries for play time and naps that don’t keep you from earning a living. (Reading is great, but starvation is bad!)</p>\n<p>If you’re an introvert like me, you might feel tempted to never leave your home because everything you need is right there. Don’t get sucked into this vortex. We all need to go out sometimes, even if it’s just for a walk by ourselves. Try to plan regular outings. Join a professional organization related to your work, a Toastmasters club, a book club or anything else that will get you out of the house and socializing on occasion. Being a complete hermit is never a good idea.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p>Working from home can be great. I love being able to sleep late and have a commute that’s about 10 steps long. I don’t have to get gussied up to go anywhere and I can decide what I want for lunch at lunch time. The dog and I can take a break and go for a stroll midday. I even have someone to talk to in person when my husband gets home from work. But that doesn’t mean working from home is a perfect solution.</p>\n<p>To set yourself up for success, create a good workspace and plan specific work and leisure times. Talking to others who work from home is also a great way to learn new tips and coping mechanisms, so try to cultivate relationships with other self-employed people. With a little careful planning, you can have a successful work-from-home life that brings you satisfaction!</p>\n<p><em>Do you work from home?

The very first time I had been to Winnipeg was on a cold December afternoon when my family moved from Russia to Canada. Our friends met us at the airport, and we drove straight from the airport to a small city just south of Winnipeg. Winnipeg and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to know each other yet.</p>\n<p>The next few times when I visited Winnipeg with friends, we mainly went shopping at <a href=\"https://www.cfshops.com/polo-park.html\">Polo Park</a>. To really get to know the city, you need to get out and explore its oldest parts. You must open your eyes to seeing history, and your ears to hearing what the city wants to tell you. That is exactly what happened to me when I came back to Winnipeg with a pile of documents to apply to college.</p>\n<p>That morning, my sister and I had one specific mission: to explore. We got Starbucks and started our walk from the <a href=\"https://www.fairmont.com/winnipeg/\">Fairmont Hotel</a> on Portage Avenue, through the <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\">Exchange District</a>, and back to Portage Avenue. I was lifting my eyes, trying to catch architectural details on buildings like the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank on Main Street</a>, <a href=\"http://pantagesplayhouse.com/\">Pantages Playhouse Theatre</a> on Market Street, the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> on King Street, and others. I was enjoying the fresh summer morning air and a strong feeling of familiarity that was pressing on me from all sides. It was a long walk, but that morning something hit me. It was <em>déjà vu</em> feeling that I had already been in this place before. I felt like I&#8217;d seen it before, and not just once.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3876\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3876\" style=\"width: 819px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSe9ybtBCjl/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3876 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-770x963.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-293x366.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @arianneyuson from Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Later, while studying in college and spending all my free time in the Exchange District, I found out that movies about early 20th century Chicago had been shot in Winnipeg. Puzzle pieces fell into place. That is where I had seen these streets before I fell in love with them! I&#8217;d seen the <a href=\"https://mbfilmmusic.ca/en/film/filming-in-manitoba\">streets of Winnipeg in movies</a> when I still lived in Russia.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has been called &#8220;Little Chicago&#8221; or most commonly &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_District\">The Chicago of the North</a>&#8221; for good reason. At the turn of the century, Chicago and Winnipeg were rivals. Is that hard to believe? Before World War I, Winnipeg was the fastest-growing city in North America. By 1911 Winnipeg was the third-largest city in Canada. Winnipeg, like Chicago, was an international finance, industry, and transportation hub. From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, Chicago architects came to Winnipeg to practice their art and technique in buildings designs. They designed many buildings in the Exchange District. The Chicago architects&#8217; style influenced and inspired local Winnipeg architects, and the city kept growing in the Chicago style.</p>\n<p>One of the best examples of the Chicago style is the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> at 66 King Street. Personally, this building always made my imagination run towards early <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/\">Woody Allen</a> movies about New York, love, and love in New York. (Even though we’re talking about Chicago.) The building was designed by <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/atchison_jd.shtml\">J.D. Atchison</a>, a Chicago architect who moved to Winnipeg in 1905. Atchison designed nearly 100 buildings in the Exchange District area.</p>\n<p>I also want to highlight the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/confederationbuilding.shtml\">Confederation Life Building on Main Street</a>. I remember walking by that building, staring at its detail and marvelling at how much effort and creativity someone had to put into it. The Confederation Life Building was designed by a Toronto architect named <a href=\"https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=5950\">Wilson Gray</a>, who was influenced by Chicago style. This building is such an example of power, dignity, and strength that it takes your breath just for a moment. Next time you walk downtown and turn on Main Street, pay attention to the roof of the building. I promise, the details will surprise you, and perhaps inspire you to create something beautiful yourself.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3874\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Many locations in Winnipeg were inspired by the Chicago style. That’s why film directors do not hesitate to use Winnipeg streets as location sets when a plot includes scenes in 20th century Chicago. &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358135/locations\">Shall We Dance</a>,&#8221; with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, was shot in Winnipeg but set in Chicago. Just writing this makes me want to watch that movie again and point out all the familiar streets that now hold so many memories for me.</p>\n<p>Other common links between Winnipeg and Chicago are water and wind. Chicago is located on the shores of Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River; Winnipeg was born at the cross of the Assiniboine and Red rivers. Both cities are built on an open prairie area near a fresh water source. At the beginning of 20th century, Winnipeg was a transportation hub, with access to one of the longest rivers in Canada (the Assiniboine River stretches over 1,070 kilometres).</p>\n<p>Being built on open shores of lakes and rivers explains why both cities are known as windy cities. The average wind speed in Chicago is 16.6 km/hr, while Winnipeg wind speeds can reach 17.1 km/hr. If you think those are not big numbers, try to stand at the intersection of Portage and Main on a cold and windy February afternoon! Winnipeg’s wind speed is the second highest of any city in Canada, after Regina, Saskatchewan (18.4 km/hr). Chicago is also in second place, after Boston, Massachusetts (20.0 km/hr). On November 20, 1892, the Freeborn County Standard of Albert Lea, Minnesota, had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windy_City_(nickname)\">this to say</a> about Chicago being called the Windy City:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3880 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“But in another sense, Chicago is actually earning the title of the ‘windy’ city. It is one of the effects of the tall buildings, which engineers and architects apparently did not foresee that the wind is sucked down into the streets. Go ahead and walk past the Masonic Temple or the Auditorium. A day that may be perfectly calm elsewhere, will meet you with a lively breeze at the base of the buildings that will compel you to put your hand to your hat.”</p>\n<p>I’ve experienced exactly that many times while walking in downtown Winnipeg. The summer wind always tries to take my hats (but I always catch them, and lucky strangers get a laugh as I jog after my hat).</p>\n<p>Winnipeg, the Chicago of the North, has everything you need to take a trip back in time and land in 1905 Chicago. Chicago’s influence is all around: J.D. Atchison designed both the <a href=\"https://www.cmu.ca/\">Canadian Mennonite University</a>, the stunning <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank Building</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.virtual.heritagewinnipeg.com/vignettes/vignettes_039.htm\">Great-West Life building on Lombard Avenue</a>.</p>\n<p>The architecture in our city is beautiful and artistic; open your eyes, turn on your imagination, and maybe even look into the history of your favourite buildings. The effort is so worth it.</p>\n<p><em>Now, it is your turn to share!

And with the housing market rising, everyone seems to have advice about this decision. Millennials who are moving to bigger cities feel the pressure to get into the market. They’re told that buying is the smart move, and renting is just throwing away money. But is it? I took a look at the numbers and found six reasons why renting for Millennials is sometimes the best option.</p>\n<h3>“You build equity when you buy a house”</h3>\n<p>This statement is<a href=\"https://affordanything.com/is-renting-better-than-buying-should-i-rent-or-buy/\"> frequently used as an argument against renting</a>. The tenant rents for years and the landlord makes a profit, when the tenant could be using that money to save for a down payment or paying off a mortgage. On a basic level this is true, but it overstates the idea of gaining <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> from owning a property. Most 30-year mortgages build very little equity over the first 20 years, and only start building equity in the last decade. Most of your mortgage payment in the first two-thirds of time that you own a property is going towards insurance, taxes, and the organization that gave you the mortgage. Unless you’re very sure you are going to live in this house for the next 30 years, you’ll build minimal equity.</p>\n<p>House values also tend to increase with inflation. There have been very few periods in the last 100 years when house prices have risen beyond inflation, and when they did, they eventually declined when the “bubble burst.” When a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_bubble.asp\">housing bubble</a> bursts, the market value of your home quickly declines—but your mortgage debt doesn’t. Unless you get lucky and buy the right property at the exact right time in the right location, the chance of your house value rising by significantly more than the rate of inflation is minimal.</p>\n<h3>Being tied to a place for an allotted time</h3>\n<p>Millennials are lucky to have started our careers at a time dominated by technology. Many people have the freedom to work remotely from their computer. This freedom does not mesh well with a mortgage payment, which only sees equity growth in its later years. The economy is changing, and Millennials tend to go back to school or switch careers more often than baby boomers, but there’s little incentive for us to tie ourselves down to a 30-year mortgage until we know we’ll be staying in one place for a long time. Renting allows Millennials the freedom to spend money on travel, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/petesaunders1/2017/01/12/where-educated-millennials-are-moving/#f706ec0d3ccc\">starting a business</a>, or paying off student debt, rather than having money tied down in a place where you aren’t sure you will want to live for the next three decades.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3672 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Millenials, renting, buying a house, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>There are better ways to grow your wealth</h3>\n<p>Not only are the gains of equity from buying a house in some ways overstated, but if investment is your goal, there are more profitable ways to go about it. Renting can save you a lot of money on your yearly spending, and that money can be used to invest in stocks, ETF’s, Index Mutual funds, RRSP’s and other investment strategies that have a higher overall gain. As mentioned above, house prices tend to increase alongside inflation. Adjusting for that, a house in 1897 cost the same as a house in 1997. As for investing, The Financial Planning Standards Council <a href=\"https://www.tangerine.ca/forwardthinking/investing/what-is-a-realistic-rate-of-return-on-an-investment-portfolio\">states that</a>, “Return assumptions for a balanced portfolio range from 4.55%…to 6.05%.” Therefore, investing in stocks and bonds with the cash you’ve saved from renting is a more profitable option. The money you gain over years can be used to buy a home in a city that you know you’ll stay in.</p>\n<h3>Peace of mind</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/reasons-renting-is-better-than-buying.aspx\">lack of stress about maintenance or repair fees is a major perk of renting</a> as well, as the landlord or building manager responsible for these. This removes a major source of worry from your life as a renter, since you don’t have to think about replacing the furnace or the pipes if they break or hiring someone to check problems in your house. I know many homeowners who are frustrated with the amount of work they have to do just to maintain their living space. Renovations and repairs can be a huge drain, both financially and of your time. Renting allows you to spend your free time enjoying your home, not just keeping it in order.</p>\n<p>Another way renting removes stress is that you don’t have to worry about fluctuating markets and property taxes. <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/cca/rtb/rentincreaseguideline/calculate.html\">In Manitoba, the most rent can increase is 1% and 3% each year (with some exceptions)</a>, which many renters can manage. Property taxes, on the other hand, can rise by more, and the value of your home can swing wildly without you having any ability to budget for it. Knowing how much you are paying at the beginning of every month is a big stress reliever for Millennials, who often freelance and work jobs that are more fluid.</p>\n<h3>Amenities and extras</h3>\n<p>Not a lot of people have a pool, a gym, a party room, or a tennis court in their house. But with a lot of newer condominiums, these are built in! These facilities are right in the building and make exercise and social gatherings easy and affordable, which is important in our society where we all seem to be so busy. These amenities would normally require Millennials to pay a membership to a gym or club, plus transportation costs. With many buildings having these amenities built in, it saves renters both money and time. Not to mention the cost of having these perks in your home as an owner would vastly outweigh what renters spend for building fees in a year!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3674\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3674\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3674\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Amenities, Gym, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3674\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Humphrey Muleba from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Another benefit with renting a condo or apartment is that you are surrounded by a built-in community. Many of my good friends are people who rented beside me, went to the dog park at my building or who I just bumped into in my neighbourhood at some point. You’re surrounded by hundreds of neighbours in an apartment building, which can come in handy when you need someone to watch your dog for a day, borrow a drill for a project, or just want to get together with some new friends.</p>\n<h3>It is the best option</h3>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/young-money/student-debt-the-crippling-side-effect-of-education\">rising student debt</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/house-prices-affordability-income-1.4966211\">tough housing market</a>, many Millennials have no choice but to move back in with their parents after going to college or university. In these cases, for a young professional looking to live on their own, renting is a better option. The freedom of living on your own without the stress of the housing market allows Millennials to get closer to their dreams while saving up money and building a life.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/its-better-to-rent-than-to-buy-in-todays-housing-market.html\">new research</a> from Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University Faculty, “Renting and reinvesting the savings from renting, on average, will outperform owning and building home equity, in terms of wealth creation,” which can allow younger people to live the life they want. Traveling, being in a city, having a safe home, and chasing your career: all of this is possible and more attainable while renting. Renting isn’t throwing away money; you get to live in a place with all the amenities of owning a home, without any of the costs of upkeep! Don’t let old advice keep you from living your dream.</p>\n<p><em>Have you chosen to rent? Are you a happy homeowner?

Don’t waste time feeling embarrassed; we’ve all been there! Follow these quick tips and you’ll feel like you have a new apartment by spring.</p>\n<h3>Create a Schedule and Set Aside the Time</h3>\n<p>Start off by making a list of all the rooms in your apartment, and don’t forget coat closets or cleaning supplies closets! No two rooms will need the same amount of time; your bathroom might take 30 minutes whereas your bedroom could take half a day.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve identified the rooms you need to tackle, create a schedule and be specific about what you hope to accomplish in each room. For example, your goal for your kitchen might be to create more countertop room, or you might want to clear more wardrobe space in your bedroom.</p>\n<h3>Out with the Old</h3>\n<p>Winter clothing can truly take a beating in these harsh chilly months. Set aside a couple of hours and inspect your wardrobe. Recycle any hole-infested sweaters and worn-down thermal socks.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3617\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3617\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3617\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3617\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Dan Gold from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Clothes are one of the easiest things to collect and hoard within your home. Ask yourself, “Have I worn this in the past 6 months?” If you haven’t (be honest!) and there’s no sentimental value to it (like a wedding dress or your grandmother’s hand-knit sweater,) donate it. You’ll thank yourself later when looking for your favourite shirt doesn’t count as an arm workout.</p>\n<p>If you are anything like me, you fear getting rid of stuff because you can’t help but think, “<em>But what if I need this later?</em>” Trust me on this: You’re never going to need those hotel toiletries you snagged on your past six vacations, or that one phone charger that works when you place it just right—it’s time to toss ‘em!</p>\n<h3>Become Friends with your Countertops and Tables Again</h3>\n<p>Flat surfaces in your apartment accumulate the most clutter because it’s just so easy to let things pile up. Remove every item from the surface, including decorations, appliances and all the haphazard junk. Lay everything out on a flat surface like another table (or even the floor), so you have a clear view of each item.</p>\n<p>An easy place to start is by throwing away all the random flyers, coupons and other non-important loose papers that tend to accumulate. Next, tackle things that spark more annoyance than joy, such as decorations you don’t remember buying.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve picked the items worthy of being on your counter or table, find a permanent home for them in a convenient and logical spot. Be selective of what you keep on your counters; you don’t need to have every single appliance on the counter! If you don’t use it every day, store it in a cabinet or on top of the fridge.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Forget to Tackle the Junk Drawer</h3>\n<p>Drawers are the first place you throw miscellaneous stuff into, especially when you’re quickly tidying up. I get it; out of sight, out of mind. But this spring, we’re reversing that mindset! The purpose of a junk drawer is to provide a place to store all the little odds and ends that don&#8217;t quite fit in anywhere else. This is still possible, but it can be done in a more intentional way.</p>\n<p>Toss anything that is expired, unnecessary or is just plain garbage. Keep extra batteries, packs of pens and chip clips, but get rid of extra chopsticks, expired coupons, and that stack of random business cards.</p>\n<h3>Ready, Shreddy, Go!</h3>\n<p>Paper junk can collect quickly, like old receipts, bank invoices or even more of those random business cards. Shredding these will clear up your office space.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3623\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3623\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3623\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-169x300.jpg 169w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-770x1369.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-500x889.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-293x521.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2.jpg 838w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3623\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Felipe Bustillo from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Collections of any Kinds Have to Go</h3>\n<p>Items like books, CD’s or DVD’s can really pile up over the years. Ask yourself if these mementos are necessary, or just part of your past that you’re holding onto. It’s a brave, new virtual world, and most of us don’t even have CD/DVD players any more thanks to Netflix. So why are you wasting space for stacks of CDs from the early 2000s?</p>\n<p>The same thing goes for books. It might be nice to look like a bookworm when your friends pop by, but you know they’re mostly just taking up space. This doesn’t mean you have to give up every book but ask yourself if you’ll really ever read it again. If you won’t, donate it.</p>\n<p>Quick Tip: Donate your books to newcomer organizations (such as N.E.E.D.S) or a senior living facility!</p>\n<h3>Be Ruthless</h3>\n<p>Getting rid of stuff in your home is difficult at first because we create connections with items. But, once you get the hang of it, you’ll wonder why you didn’t tackle it sooner!</p>\n<h3>Organize the Rest</h3>\n<p>Decluttering isn’t just about getting rid of stuff; it’s also about knowing how to manage what you have. From racks, baskets, or under-bed storage, there’s an assortment of storage products for every need on the market.</p>\n<h3>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</h3>\n<p>A forgotten place that is one of the most convenient storage spaces is hiding out under your bed. Grab a few thin, narrow bins and you have the perfect place to store out of season clothes, booksyou want to keep but don’t need on your shelf, or any mish-mashed items that don’t seem to have a place but that you know you need.</p>\n<p>Shelving units are also a great way to kill two birds with one stone: Grab a few baskets and tuck away all those miscellaneous items such as cords or craft supplies. Your shelves will look neat and aesthetically pleasing, and what they hold is your little secret.</p>\n<h3>Celebrate!</h3>\n<p>Now that your hard work is over, sit back and celebrate Apartment 2.0! Now your mission is to keep your home decluttered. Remember to follow the golden rule: Only bring things into your home that you actually need and will use. Once your apartment is decluttered, it’s easy to follow into old habits and end up buying more stuff you don’t need.</p>\n<p>Before bringing something new into your home, ask yourself, “Do I need this? How will this benefit my home?” If you can’t answer both questions, don’t buy it. Another great trick is the one in, one out rule. For every item that comes into your apartment, try to get rid of one item so you don’t end up with a cluttered apartment once again.</p>\n<p>These tips might seem ambitious, but you can do it! And once you see how freeing it can feel to have less <em>stuff</em> around you, you’ll be kicking yourself for not starting sooner.

The menu has tons of options to try on your subsequent visits, so variety isn’t an issue. Everything is decently priced, with nothing on the menu costing more than $40. Peasant Cookery is a perfect date night spot or a place to get the girls together to enjoy a specialty cocktail. With Peasant Cookery, every bite shows you how much heart and soul go into each meal!</p>\n<p>The service matches the atmosphere: high class. No matter how busy the restaurant, is the servers are always available and will graciously help you map out the best courses for your palate.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"http://peasantcookery.ca/menus/dinner/\">Aged cheddar gnocchi</a> with the Sandman cocktail</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Fast-Food-Restaurant/Mitzis-Chicken-Finger-Restaurant-115673538494068/\">Mitzi’s Chicken Finger Restaurant</a>: $</h3>\n<p>250 St. Mary Avenue</p>\n<p>In the heart of downtown, Mitzi’s chicken finger restaurant offers Chinese and Canadian cuisine—turns out, chicken fingers are delicious with a side of rice. What makes Mitzi’s stand out is that every chicken finger is prepared fresh daily! The service is also is top-notch: the staff are friendly, and treat you like a guest, rather than a customer. It’s a great place to hit up before a Jets game or as a pit-stop on your way home from work.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong>Chicken fingers (obviously!) and a side of fried rice</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.banhmikingwpg.com/\">Banh Mi King</a>: $</h3>\n<p>510 Portage Ave</p>\n<p>Banh Mi King is one of my personal favorite restaurants in downtown Winnipeg. Banh Mi King is conveniently located near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. Everything on their menu is under $20 and offers real bang for your buck. No matter what you choose, you’ll leave satisfied and on the verge of a pleasant food coma. The service is unmatched, you will always be greeted with a warm welcome by whoever is at the cash register. They’re also happy to help you navigate through their extensive menu.</p>\n<p><em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"https://www.skipthedishes.com/banh-mi-king\">Vegetarian Vietnamese sub</a></strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://acrosstheboardcafe.com/\">Across the Board Game Café</a>: $</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3521\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3521\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BsnWJqsFzwX/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3521\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Across The Board Cafe, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3521\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside Across The Board Cafe ? by @katriz on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>211 Bannatyne Ave &amp; Main Street</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a board game fanatic or just looking for a bite to eat with a side of entertainment, this café is a great choice.

It’s been analysed, discussed and debated for a long time, but it’s never been more relevant than today: Based on a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-rent-vs-buy-reader-response-road-ahead-1.4503852\">Calgary survey</a>, young professionals who can afford to buy a house still prefer to rent. I’ve heard doctors, teachers, and other professionals argue that they find renting more convenient than buying.</p>\n<p>Personally, I rented for more than four years before buying a home, and I think renting is an underrated option. People will always have different opinions, and I find myself somewhere in between. I enjoy home ownership just outside of the city; I also enjoyed renting a 17<sup>th</sup>-floor apartment in downtown Winnipeg. Home ownership isn’t for everyone, and I’m here to show you that renting a home has more advantages than you might think.</p>\n<h3>Renting is more affordable.</h3>\n<p>When you purchase a home, you don&#8217;t just pay for the property itself. You can also look forward to taxes, mortgage interest and other fees. In addition to those basics, there will be other expenses depending on the type of property you buy. We purchased a duplex, and it wasn’t long before the extra costs started to add up: gardens, fencing, driveways and landscaping are expensive!</p>\n<p>Understanding the true cost of homeownership is not as simple as comparing a monthly mortgage payment to a rent payment. Don’t even get me started on condo fees, utilities and insurance. When buying a house, you also need to be sure that you can afford to put down a <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/mortgages/down-payment.html\">minimum of 5% for the down payment</a>. Renters, on the other hand, don’t need to worry about most of these expenses.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3440 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg\" alt=\"bank loan, mortgage insurance, buying a house, renting an apartment, winnipeg apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-500x298.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-300x179.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-768x457.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1370x816.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3>No need to pay for maintenance.</h3>\n<p>Maintenance is such a huge factor that I think it deserves its own category. Here’s a great (and stinky) story about how well maintenances are usually completed by a rental company: When my husband and I came back to Winnipeg from our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, it was almost midnight. We were tired but woke right up when we opened the door to our apartment. It smelled like something had <em>died</em> in there. I ran to throw open the window, and my husband checked the kitchen.</p>\n<p>It turned out that the fridge had stopped working, and the contents of the fridge and freezer (including chicken, fish, and veggies) had been rotting for 2 weeks—yuck. You can imagine the smell! Long story short, we called the property management office, and they immediately replaced our fridge. It didn&#8217;t cost us a penny. Convinced yet? Let’s move on to the next point.</p>\n<h3>Renting = flexibility.</h3>\n<p>Usually, a rental lease is signed for a year, and then you have the option to renew. This way you have way more freedom in planning ahead. However, sometimes even the best-planned life scenario can be ruined by unplanned situations. It could be a sudden job offer in a different city, a family emergency, or you could just decide to move because the world is a beautiful place and you have to see more of it!</p>\n<p>If you rent, you don&#8217;t have to deal with selling a house. Renting offers valuable convenience when it comes to a quick change of plans. It saves you from looking for a buyer, paying a realtor, signing papers, and looking for a new place to buy. Hand over they keys to your landlord when your lease is up, and you’re free to move on.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3444 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Apartments, Renting vs Buying, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Living, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-500x356.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-300x213.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-768x546.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1370x974.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3>Renting involves less emotional and financial stress.</h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever been interested in buying a property, you’ve probably noticed that interest rates are rising. Mortgage interest rates are the highest they’ve been in 5 years, and it looks like they are destined to climb even more.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you cannot afford to put down 20% as a down payment, you are required to purchase mortgage insurance. Just to give a point of reference, we had to pay close to $10,000 in <a href=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/buying/mortgage-loan-insurance-for-consumers\">mortgage insurance</a> on a house purchase in the mid-$300,000 range. Property taxes in most cities have also been increasing. Taxes and interest rates add a substantial cost to home ownership that sometimes makes buying a home financially unfeasible.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, renting isn’t a money drain. You’re paying for the roof above your head and shelter for your family. You can save on monthly expenditures and have more flexibility when it comes to your life plans. Get the most bang for your buck by investing any money that you save monthly by renting instead of owning. Over 40 years, a diversified investment portfolio can yield an equal or even greater return than investing in buying a home. Renting a place doesn’t make you a homeowner, but it does free up cash flow that might otherwise be going to taxes, a mortgage, and unexpected expenses.</p>\n<h3>Make the decision that’s right for you</h3>\n<p>The decision whether to buy or rent a home shouldn’t be made lightly. It should involve being honest with yourself about what you want, what you need, and lists—lots of lists with numbers that will show you the advantages and disadvantages of either decision. Consider your lifestyle, your finances, and your plans. Whatever you decide, make the right decision for <em>you</em>, and don’t worry about what others think.</p>\n<p><em>Now, let’s hear your opinion!

It was the first time I didn’t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn’t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.</p>\n<p>But while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it’s pretty small—at around 500 square feet—and narrow enough that I can’t fit furniture on both sides of the living/dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn’t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.</p>\n<p>I’m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/anxiety-zen/201612/minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health\">feel</a> unburdened in the place that should matter most—home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.</p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>When you have less space to leave things lying around, you can’t afford to have much clutter! Even if you’re not a messy person, it’s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It’s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn’t really want, impulse buys you could’ve done without, and clothing and shoes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don’t want to be looking at your things, especially if it’s miscellaneous stuff you’re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!</p>\n<p>Before you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don’t want or need (<a href=\"https://www.siloam.ca/donate/donate/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE\">Siloam Mission</a> gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you’ll have more room to work with.</p>\n<p>For storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.</p>\n<p>Under the bed is a great place to store items you don’t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.</p>\n<p>If your building has storage lockers, use yours! They’re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.</p>\n<h3>Furniture</h3>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://hutk.ca/\">choosing furniture</a> for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don’t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don’t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.</p>\n<p>Go for <a href=\"http://www.interiorillusions.ca/product-category/furniture/living-room/accent-chairs/\">sleek armless chairs</a>, and try transparent coffee tables, which won’t look like they’re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3430\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3430\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"940\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3430\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by @interior_illusions on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Dual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you’re not using them.</p>\n<p>Look into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you’re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you’re hosting brunch.</p>\n<p>For storing things like books and <a href=\"http://intothemusic.ca/\">records</a>, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You’ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They’re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.</p>\n<p>A TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector—they’re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.</p>\n<h3>Decoration</h3>\n<p>Plants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they’re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered. Stop by <a href=\"http://verdeplantdesign.com/\">Verde Plant Design</a> for a great selection!</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to decorate your walls with <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/visit/shop\">art</a> that you love. Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.</p>\n<p>Hang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame—it’ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.</p>\n<p>When it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>Where do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can’t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don’t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Any tips for decorating a small space?

I began my downtown living journey when I was 19, and I’ve never looked back. Something about downtown caught my interest when I was ready to move from my 130 square foot dormitory into a more grown-up apartment.</p>\n<p>As a young adult, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to create a life in an urban or suburban area. The wonderful thing about downtown Winnipeg is that combines the very best parts of Winnipeg into one neighbourhood! As the years advance and I shuffle between different downtown streets, downtown feels more and more like home.</p>\n<p>Whether you love parks, museums, music venues or creative attractions, downtown Winnipeg has something to make your heart sing. Downtown really optimizes its space with something interesting to see, eat and/or do around every corner.</p>\n<h3>A Mixture of Old and New</h3>\n<p>Downtown mixes the old and the new, showcasing Winnipeg’s attachment to its historical buildings by preserving them, scattered between modernized high rises. The older buildings are comforting and make downtown feel like more than just another concrete jungle. These mature buildings are one of the major reasons why I moved and stayed downtown; they’re full of stories of what Winnipeg used to be like, and how my grandparents and parents lived their lives in these streets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3318\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3318\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Archway at the Grain Exchange, Exchange District, Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-768x512.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1370x913.png 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway.png 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Archway at the Grain Exchange building, Winnipeg</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>You’re Never Hungry</h3>\n<p>Downtown serves as a melting pot, bringing together diverse people into one place—and it really shows through the food! There’s an assortment of eateries, which is great news for foodies like me. You can turn on to any street and be greeted by mom-and-pop bistros, one-of-a-kind cafes, or the familiar chain restaurants you can eat at just about everywhere (which I swear taste better downtown, for some reason). Food and I have a pretty steady relationship, and by living downtown I get the opportunity to experiment with all sorts of flavours!</p>\n<h3>Building Connections</h3>\n<p>Small town living has its romance, but urban living creates intense proximity between you and the people around you. It’s a common misconception that people who live in the heart of cities don’t interact with each other, but I beg to differ! You share laughs with the people at the bus stop as you joke about how Winnipeg Transit buses never seem to arrive on time, make small talk with the folks on the bus that you’re sardined against, groan along with people as you wait in the ridiculously long line at Tim’s, and smile at the person who held the elevator door open for you. These small but meaningful interactions make up the connections of downtown dwellers. You feel that connection because frankly, you can’t help it—you’re always in close proximity to someone.</p>\n<h3>The People Around You</h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that in some cities, downtown can seem cold and unwelcoming. However, I believe that the benefits of urban living can be seen in each unique neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood tells the story of the people who live there, and my neighbourhood downtown is full of people from all walks of life. In my apartment building, my neighbours include a family from across the pond who made me fresh juice when I moved in, an elderly man who gives everyone a Christmas card each year, and a few male university students who shovel the front walkway every winter without being asked. Maybe I’m lucky to know my neighbours, but with the hustle and bustle of downtown life, these types of people really shine a light on downtown Winnipeg’s unique spirit.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsx_u52AA8z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

For example, if you like being in the center of everything, consider streets in the core of downtown Winnipeg. Streets like Graham, Garry and some areas of Portage Avenue are a five-minute walk from popular bars, restaurants and Bell MTS Place.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for somewhere more cosmopolitan, right in the middle of a richly varied area—the Exchange District may be your perfect match! This vibrant neighbourhood boasts many of Winnipeg’s one-of-a-kind boutiques, coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Also, it’s near the Centennial Concert Hall and Winnipeg’s own China Town.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtNESe3AwDL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtNESe3AwDL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by @andrewmahon</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-01-29T03:56:35+00:00\">Jan 28, 2019 at 7:56pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>If you’re interested in a more laid-back neighbourhood that’s still close to entertainment, check out West Broadway. It’s known for being an unofficial boundary between the hustle bustle commercial parts of downtown and the residential areas, so you get the best of both worlds. Backing onto the Assiniboine River, it’s a picturesque area with elm tree canopies over streets and beautiful historic buildings.</p>\n<p>Do some extra exploring around the area to make sure it has your must-haves for a neighbourhood. Keep an eye out for nearby grocery stores, drugstores, and bus stops.</p>\n<p>When walking around the streets outside a potential apartment, do you feel at home? Can you picture yourself showing your friends and family around the streets near the building? That’s a good sign.</p>\n<h3>Size Does Matter</h3>\n<p>When looking for somewhere to call home, you might start to feel like Goldilocks trying to find just the right size. Starting your apartment hunt with your basic space needs figured out will make a world of difference. Consider the following for determining the square feet of your future living space.</p>\n<p>Do you own a lot of larger-scale furniture that needs to be accommodated—such as a pool table, a piano or a bulky sectional sofa? How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you want? Are you the type to spend a ton of time in your bedroom, or do you need a spacious living room? Do you love to host parties and need seating for your entourage?</p>\n<p>If you’re moving from one place to another, you might want to look for something close to the same size. If you are moving into a larger place remember that you’ll have to shell out money to fill it with furniture—an empty apartment just doesn’t feel homey!</p>\n<p>And don’t forget about storage: how much stuff do you need to store? When touring a place or even just looking at a listing on Kijiji, pay attention to the number and size of closets. Look for a bathroom closet, kitchen storage (like cupboards or a pantry) and a coat closet. A lack of storage space can go unnoticed until move-in day when you don’t know where you’re going to store your cleaning supplies or winter coats.</p>\n<h3>Nancy Drew that Apartment</h3>\n<p>There’s nothing worse than moving into an apartment and finding unpleasant surprises in the crooks and crannies, so put on that detective hat. When you view a potential apartment, look closely at ceilings, walls and floors for any cracks, stains or other damage. Check the appliances: open the refrigerator and the oven and try out the sink faucets. Look for signs of wear and tear; these may not be necessarily deal-breakers for you, but something to alert the landlord about so you don’t get dinged on your security deposit.</p>\n<p>Also, check the cellphone reception in every room! Cellphones are a huge part of our lives so make sure you walk around the apartment checking your service bars or sending a quick text or two.</p>\n<h3>Scope out the Neighbours</h3>\n<p>If you pass someone living inside the apartment building you’re touring, say hello! Whether they say hello back, stop to chat or just walk right by will give you an idea of what your potential neighbours are like.</p>\n<p>The perfect neighbours only exist in Hallmark movies, but you do want to feel comfortable with the people around you. It depends on the type of person you are but having neighbours that you can at least smile at in the hallways might be important to you.</p>\n<h3>Identify Must-Have Amenities</h3>\n<p>These are different for everyone, but here are three that we consider deal-breakers:</p>\n<p>A dishwasher: You can theoretically live without a dishwasher—but for the sake of your sanity and the environment, look for an apartment with one.</p>\n<p>An elevator: Stairs may help you with your step counter on your FitBit, but on move-in day, when you’re trying to move your couch up three flights of stairs, you’ll be kicking yourself for renting the place!</p>\n<p>Laundry facilities: Take it from someone who is a serial renter: an on-site laundry room is the holy grail of apartment living. Having to lug all your dirty clothes back and forth from a laundromat is a pain. Do yourself a favour and put a laundry room on your list of non-negotiables.</p>\n<h3>Trust Your Instincts</h3>\n<p>We don&#8217;t call the places where we live home without a reason. If the price is right but something just feels wrong—even if you can’t pinpoint what—trust that feeling and keep searching. The right apartment should be your home base, your personal launchpad for taking on the day and where you can cozy up to recharge.</p>\n<p>Have some pro tips for scoring the perfect apartment?

Walking your dog in the downtown helps you feel like you’re instantly part of a community of dog owners. Dogs are great companions; they’re your best friend, and keep you warm on a cold winter night. On a bad day, a doggie tail wiggle will definitely cheer you up.</p>\n<p>Some people say that having a dog is like having a child. I would say it’s like having a child that <em>never grows up</em>. But as dog lovers know, they’re worth the work! Having a dog while living in an apartment can actually help you stay motivated to get outside. Dogs need exercise, and can develop health problems if they don’t get enough. No one wants their furry friend to get sick!</p>\n<p>So no matter how snowy, cold, rainy, or hot it is outside, you put a leash on your excited dog and get yourself outside. Sometimes it’s eye-wateringly early and you’re dreaming about your warm bed, but Fido needs his walk. And as a bonus, you get to enjoy as much fresh air and physical activity as your pet! (Ever notice how fit some dog owners are?)</p>\n<p>But here’s the problem: Your dog is all excited about going out to see the big world, but you have no idea where to go or what route to take this time. You’re in luck: here’s a list of 5 beautiful places and parks in Winnipeg within a 20-minute walk of 300 Main Street:</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrTa1dpAcvV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrTa1dpAcvV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by David Metcalfe (@davidmetclfe)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-12T22:06:15+00:00\">Dec 12, 2018 at 2:06pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.winnipeg.ca/PublicWorks/parksOpenSpace/OffLeashDogParks/DTDogPark.stm\">Bonnycastle Dog Park</a></strong>. The park is just a 12-minute walk from 300 Main Street. It’s located in the beautiful Assiniboine Avenue area, right across from the <a href=\"https://www.fortgarryhotel.com/\">Fort Garry Hotel</a>. I love spending summer days here, just walking around and seeing happy dog owners playing with their pets! The park even has a bottle-refill fountain that operates in the hot summer months. Bonnycastle Park was opened in February 2016 and has become very popular with downtown doggies. The off-leash park is fully fenced and has almost 13,000 square feet of playing area. Its design includes artificial turf that was specifically designed for dog parks. Take your dog to Bonnycastle dog park—I promise you both will enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>2.<a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\"> The Forks</a>.</strong> You can’t let your dog go off-leash in this heritage area, but why not combine your dog walk with some entertainment for yourself? The Forks is just a 9-minute walk away from 300 Main Street. In the summertime, wander around with an ice cream in one hand and dog’s leash in the other while listening to buskers. In the wintertime, enjoy Christmas lights, watch people skate and absorb the joyful holiday vibes. Keep in mind that the Forks can get very crowded during festivals; unless your furry friend is very used to big crowds of people, you might want to avoid busy days.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc6VNxqjs2x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc6VNxqjs2x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">every time I visit this place I make a new friend</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/93mp/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Winnipeg</a> (@93mp) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-12-20T04:56:37+00:00\">Dec 19, 2017 at 8:56pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/business/central-park/\">Central Park</a>.</strong> This park is not an off-leash dog park, but pet owners love it anyway. After a 17-minute walk away from downtown, you can stroll in a peaceful place surrounded by historical architecture. The park is also a good place for a relaxing pause if you and your dog walked for a long time and need some rest. Bring a book and settle in on a bench to enjoy a relaxing day in the park.</p>\n<p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/pdf_folder/WaterfrontDriveExpectations.pdf\">Waterfront Drive</a>.</strong> This is one of my favourite areas in Winnipeg because it combines historical and brand-new buildings with a wide sidewalk through the park. Taking a walk here feels like wandering through a picturesque forest. Dog owners, bikers, and joggers share the walking route at Waterfront Drive. The sidewalk is paved, wide, and well maintained, and runs right beside the mighty Red River. It’s a lovely place to have some quality time by yourself, with a good friend, or with your dog.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The Legislative Grounds.</strong> The park around the monumental <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a> is easily one of the best in Winnipeg for walking with your dog. The Legislative Grounds are a bit further from 300 Main, clocking in at 21 minutes at a walking pace, but it’s worth the extra effort. It’s peaceful right in the middle of the city, and it’s always full of dogs and their owners enjoying some time together. Personally, I believe the Legislative Grounds are so popular because it feels like time stands still there. As soon as you walk into the park and see the Legislative Building, you slow down, and a strong feeling of being part of history overcomes you. Seriously—just put a leash on your dog and go experience it for yourself. Just forget about your cell phone in your pocket, and lift your eyes to the ledges of the Manitoba Legislative Building. The details might surprise you.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrQCBAEDlO9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrQCBAEDlO9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mommy, look!

It can also be lonely, so some of us choose to have roommates for companionship. Whatever your reasons might be, living with roommates can be a lovely—or disastrous—experience.</p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<p>Splitting living costs means you have more money for other things. You can also create great memories with roommates. I’ve had roomies off and on in my life, particularly in my university years. One of my favourite aspects of living with others is the meshing of traditions and cultures around the holidays. One year, three of us celebrated Christmas and two celebrated Hanukkah. We decided to mash everything together and made a Chrismukkah tree. It was a traditional Christmas evergreen tree, but we covered it in blue and silver decorations (the colours of Hannukah) and used a big Star of David as a tree topper. It was fun watching the roomies who’d never had a tree try to figure out how to hang balls and baubles, as those little squeezable hooks aren’t really used for anything but Christmas decorations. We also got to teach our roommates all of the lyrics to cheesy Christmas songs. And later that school year, I learned how to celebrate Passover. We always enjoyed our combined holiday events.</p>\n<p>Being students, we had lots of silly drunken nights and sometimes came up with imaginative solutions to our problems. We had been given a TV by one set of parents, but it had no remote control. We were entirely too lazy to get up and change the channel, so one night we found some duct tape and taped all of our wooden spoons and spatulas together in a long line that reached from the couch to the TV. It served as a handy, and remarkably sturdy, remote control for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And having roommates means there is often someone there to talk to and do things with without having to schedule plans days in advance, which is a nice bonus.</p>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<p>Having roomies isn’t always idyllic. Living with others is often fraught with annoyances and drama. One of the most common fights is over cleanliness, or lack thereof. I’m sure our bathrooms were teeming with germs, as no one ever wanted to clean them. We had the same problem with dishes. No one ever believed it was their turn to wash, so the dishes just piled up in the sink in ever-teetering towers.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2955\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2955\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2955\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png\" alt=\"dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-500x340.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-300x204.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-768x522.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by rawpixel on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Your best bet to avoid similar problems is to have a conversation with your roomies right at the start, to decide what is and isn’t acceptable for everyone. You may also want to create a chore schedule so everyone knows exactly who will be doing what and by when.</p>\n<p>Another issue can be sharing food or other resources. You should decide right away if you are sharing food or keeping things completely separate. This does not guarantee success, by the way. We had one roommate in university (I’m calling her Jane to protect the guilty) who never bought her own food and pilfered from everyone else when we weren’t around. It wasn’t something we were able to successfully stop, and it was one of the reasons she ended up moving out before the year was up.</p>\n<h3>The Ugly</h3>\n<p>Some problems grow from small to breathtakingly bad. We had one roommate (surprisingly, not Jane) come back from summer break in second year with a large package in tow. She worked on her parents’ travelling carnival every summer. That year, she had fallen for a 6’8” carny and decided to bring him back to university with her. He was supposed to stay a few days, maybe a week or two, before finding his own place. He never left. He spent the entire year living with us, moving from job to job, and never contributed anything towards rent or utilities. It was an ongoing fight all year to get him to pay up or move out, but we didn’t get the big mooch to leave until we all moved out at the end of the school year.</p>\n<p>Most roommate situations don’t turn out this badly, but it’s important to know something about the person you are living with and to set clear ground rules from the start. It’s no fun if you suddenly find yourself in need of a new living situation because things have become untenable at home.</p>\n<h3>And the Downright Weird</h3>\n<p>Some roommate situations just become weird. Like Jane, who had a revolving door of friends constantly in our apartment. It’s a little disconcerting to walk into your bathroom at 7 am and find some guy you’ve never met before passed out over your toilet. (Hello, awkward conversation.)</p>\n<p>In our student apartment building, people regularly set off the fire alarm with burned popcorn and toast. But when Jane decided it would be a great idea to butt a cigarette into a wastebasket full of paper, the ensuing full-fledged fire didn’t set off the alarms until our apartment was fully consumed by smoke. Most of the damage was contained to her room, but the entire apartment had a distinctly smoky smell for weeks after. I guess my tip here is to choose your roommates wisely.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2957\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2957\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2957\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky notes, delegating, tasks, communication, assertive, apartment living, downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-500x331.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-768x509.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1370x907.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2957\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>There are benefits and drawbacks both to living alone and with others. You need to pick the option that best works for you. If you have roommates, spend a little time making the right choice or you could spend a lot of time regretting it. Set clear ground rules and expectations, and be prepared to have frank discussions when things don’t run smoothly. This happens sometimes, even with great roommates. And if you have some bad experiences, remind yourself they make great fodder for party stories later.

He would be on time for his career counselling session at <a href=\"https://manitobastart.com/\">Manitoba Start</a>, just a few blocks away. This was his first session, and he breathed an inward sigh of relief that such a great resource was so close to his apartment building. He had just arrived last week and was eager to get settled. Securing a <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/mbcard.html\">Manitoba Health Card</a> and finding a family doctor had been fairly easy. He had even been able to use the free services of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit</a> bus since everything was within a few blocks of his new apartment in downtown.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-04-17T15:34:01+00:00\">Apr 17, 2018 at 8:34am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>As he walked to his destination, Henry cast a cursory glance around him. He was amazed at the diversity; people of all ethnicities and ages walked past him, in harmony with each other yet comfortably oblivious to their own surroundings. He noticed people rushing to work, too rushed to drink their coffee yet taking the time to hold open doors for others. He was falling in love with his new home! He felt a sense of belonging and was already looking forward to the weekend. He had seen posters for <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/\">ManyFest</a> and was excited to be living a short walk from where all the action would be. As he rushed across the cross walk, he thought about his plans for the coming weekend: the festival, a visit to the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/\">public library</a> to check out their collection and perhaps some Indian cuisine at a nearby restaurant. He realized he was talking to himself as he entered the the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/downtown_winnipeg_indoor_walkway_map_2013.pdf\">Downtown Winnipeg Indoor Walkway (lovingly known as the skywalk by locals)</a> to escape the gust of wind that threatened to sweep away the documents that he had been carrying. He shook his head, smiling. He couldn’t wait to get back to his apartment to finish settling in. His days now began with sipping his morning tea while waiting for the sun to light up the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/docs/goldenboy_factsheet.pdf\">Golden Boy</a> as it serenely overlooked downtown. For the tenth time that day, he made a mental note to thank the friend who had suggested he find a place downtown to start his new life in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Heather’s iPhotos (@heathers.iphotos)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-10T05:13:20+00:00\">Dec 9, 2018 at 9:13pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>Starting a new life in an unfamiliar city can be unnerving. Resources are limited, expectations are high and there is always too much to do. That’s why it is important to choose a location that can help you get things done on the fast track. Living at the heart of the city and near all the major institutions not only saves precious time, but also gives the added advantage of being mobile even if you’re not ready to own a vehicle. It’s cost-effective to be able to walk to most places which is exactly what you’re looking for when starting your life in a new city. Better to burn calories than cents when you’re relying on your savings!</p>\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is also a great place to network, which is invaluable when you’re adjusting to a new culture and looking for a job in your field. You need to be at the right place at the right time. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html\">Service Canada</a> in <a href=\"https://portageplace.ca/\">Portage Place</a> offers free resources for job seekers.

April sees the legendary <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3824243&amp;event=Fleetwood+Mac\">Fleetwood Mac</a> come to town on the 11th, while Canadian rockers <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3823211&amp;event=Metric\">Metric</a> play on the 23rd. Country sensation <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3659325&amp;event=Carrie+Underwood%2C+Maddie+and+Tae+%26+Runaway+June\">Carrie Underwood</a> comes through on June 2nd. And taking you back to the 1980s is <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3811949&amp;event=Corey+Hart\">Corey Hart</a> on June 18th. If you go, report back on whether he still wears his sunglasses at night. (Sorry. Had to.) To see a full list of events, check out the <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/calendar/\">Bell MTS Place events calendar</a>.</p>\n<h3>Looking for Some Culture?</h3>\n<p>The ballet, opera and symphony all operate out of the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, and with the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/\">Royal Manitoba Theatre Company</a> (Royal MTC) around the corner, there is always something new to watch downtown. The <a href=\"https://buy.rwb.org/single/EventListing.aspx\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> (RWB) performs <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/romeo-juliet/\">Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> February 13th through 17th. I’ve seen this one before and can vouch for the gorgeous costumes and delightful choreography. If you’re looking for a show that will entrance young kids, the RWB will perform <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/the-wizard-of-oz/\">The Wizard of Oz</a> from May 1st to 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbopera.ca/season/the-barber-of-seville/\">Manitoba Opera</a> is putting on one of my favourite operas this spring, The Barber of Seville. This one’s a comedy, so don’t expect a long dirge. When you hear “Figaro, Figaro, Fiiiigaro!” being belted out onstage, you might recognize the famous aria featured in the Looney Tunes “Rabbit of Seville.” <a href=\"https://tickets.mbopera.ca/TheatreManager/1/login?event=281\">The Barber of Seville</a> runs April 6th, 9th and 12th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2605 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical, Musical, Theatre, Show, Downtown Winnipeg, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC), Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-500x171.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-300x103.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-768x263.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1370x470.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Tickets.aspx\">Royal MTC</a> fans, you can catch <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\">Matilda the Musical</a> (based on the Roald Dahl Book) from January 8th to February 2nd . Another option is <a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">A Doll’s House</a> from January 30st to February 16th. I’ve never heard of this one, but the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">description</a> sounds intriguing: “Henrik Ibsen’s realist masterpiece resonates more than a century after the debut of Nora Helmer, whose bourgeois illusions are shattered by the realization that she’s merely a doll in her own home.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO)</a> has events for all tastes throughout the year. The one I find most intriguing <a href=\"https://wso.ca/1819season/\">this season</a> is <a href=\"https://wso.ca/star-wars-star-trek/\">Star Wars vs. Star Trek</a>, running February 22nd to 24th. According to the WSO, “Special guest hosts Brett Megarry and Jeff Braun, from <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/winnipeg/program/couch-potatoes-cjob\">CJOB’s The Couch Potatoes</a>, settle the score with iconic music from both a galaxy far, far away and where no man has gone before.”</p>\n<p>And my last theatre recommendation is the smash musical <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=KinkyBoots&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=\">Kinky Boots</a>. The Centennial Concert Hall’s got this one from April 16th through 21st. I’ve only seen the movie version of this, and it was great. Expect the musical to be even better.</p>\n<h3>Want to Stay Warm and Burn Some Calories?</h3>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0px auto 12px; width: 50px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0px 7px; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by The Forks (@theforkswinnipeg)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-28T18:34:57+00:00\">Dec 28, 2018 at 10:34am PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/red-river-mutual-trail\">Red River Mutual Trail</a> should be open again soon (once we get some colder weather). Head down to the Forks to rent some skates and check out the world-famous <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts</a>. There are five new ones this year, including a performance hut. Norwegian ice musician <a href=\"https://wso.ca/blog/wnmf-2019-preview/\">Terje Isunget</a> will perform with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra using instruments carved from Red River ice. Sounds fascinating to me!</p>\n<p>If you want more exercise, you can always sign up for the <a href=\"https://wildwintercanoerace.com/\">Wild Winter Canoe Race</a> at <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/a-z-guide/\">Shaw Park</a> on February 16th. This involves finding a group of friends to “canoe” across the snow. (You move the canoe with your feet, like the most Canadian skateboard ever.) No need to bring your own canoe; the event will provide one for you. You can win great prizes and bragging rights.</p>\n<h3>Need Some Home Renovation or Wedding Ideas?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://winnipegrenovationshow.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2606 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png\" alt=\"Winnipeg Renovation Show, Downtown Winnipeg, RBC Convention Centre, Apartment Living, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Events, Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1021\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-500x156.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-300x93.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-768x239.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are, look no further than the <a href=\"https://www.wcc.mb.ca/\">RBC Convention Centre</a>.

Their recently-launched <a href=\"http://amsterdamtearoom.com/dinner-menu/\">new menu</a> had popped up in several of my friends’ Instagram stories, and I was eager to try it myself. The last time I’d been there, it was a quaint little tea room; it’s since transformed into a busy, hip tea bar. We grabbed seats at the bar and I ordered a hot toddy and a small plate with crispy fingerling potatoes, charred onion, cucumber, celery, ketchup aioli, mustard seeds, sesame, and pecorino cheese. The server told me that if I took a little bit of all the components of the dish in one big bite, it would taste like a Big Mac—yum!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2564\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2564\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2564 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Derek McCandless, Live Music, Amsterdam Tea Room, Exchange District, First Fridays in the Exchange, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-1370x913.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2564\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winnipeg Folk Fest performer, Derek McCandless performing at Amsterdam Tea Room on First Fridays in the Exchange on December 7, 2018.

The bar was buzzing with people, the chatter blending seamlessly into his soothing voice and guitar notes. We made a game plan and left with our bellies full, ready to take on the night.</p>\n<p>Our next stop was at <a href=\"https://www.graffitigallery.ca/\">Graffiti Gallery</a> (109 Higgins Avenue) for the opening reception of WOMAN GOOD BAD BAD: a series of all-new work by Winnipeg artist <a href=\"https://gabriellewmfunk.com/\">Gabrielle Funk</a>. The gallery floor was deliciously pink, and I fell in love instantly. Abstract pastel graphics on the walls seemed to blend in with the artwork. I later learned that the gallery is modified before every exhibition to match the artwork and create a cohesive experience.</p>\n<p>People milled about the gallery with wine glasses and kombucha bottles, bobbing their heads to music from the DJ in the corner. There were free appetizers and a cash bar, and the artwork itself was beautiful. Most of the paintings were based on friends and family members of the artist, and the faces look extremely realistic yet surreal. Through this show, Funk explores the duality of the conventional representation of women in religion, art, and the media.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2566\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2566\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2566\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Davis Studio Boutique, First Fridays in the Exchange, Exchange District, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-1370x2055.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A collection of painting by artist, Joshua Wilson at tara davis studio boutique.

It’s an eclectic and charming boutique at 246 McDermot Avenue, carrying womenswear, art, accessories, and home décor. The exhibit was called “12”—the 7th annual exhibition of 12 local artists showing 12 small works no larger than 12&#215;12”. One of the collections that caught my attention was by Joshua Wilson, an artist who paints quirky pictures of animals with cigarettes. I really wanted to take home a painting of a crab with a cigarette, but I settled for a pair of mismatched purple socks with cacti on them.</p>\n<p>My friend and I parted ways, and I walked over to <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/cinematheque/\">Cinematheque</a> (304-100 Arthur Street) for my last stop of the night: a screening of <em><a href=\"https://streamingmoviesright.com/us/movie/sorry-to-bother-you\">SORRY TO BOTHER YOU</a></em>, presented by Black Space Winnipeg. I was a little wary of going to this with just my popcorn for company, but in Winnipeg, six degrees of separation is a very real thing. I ran into friends from work and someone I went to school with, so I joined them for the movie.</p>\n<p>Cinematheque is one of those old-school movie theaters that brings back the romance of movie watching. The architecture of the <a href=\"https://art-space.ca/artspace-building/\">ArtSpace</a> building is stunning and the theatres are small and intimate. Before heading into the showing, I stopped at the bar for a glass of wine to go with my popcorn.</p>\n<p>The movie started a little late, but no one seemed to mind. Written and directed by Boots Riley and starring <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3147751/\">Lakeith Stanfield</a>, Sorry to Bother You is a dystopian comedy that addresses societal issues like racism and commercialism. (The ending will leave you feeling unsettled in the best way possible.) It’s both thoughtful and hilarious, with tremendous actors.</p>\n<p>It was almost midnight by the time the movie ended. Over at <a href=\"https://www.thetallestpoppy.com/\">The Tallest Poppy</a> (103 Sherbrook Street), <a href=\"https://www.synonymartconsultation.com/\">Synonym</a>’s First Friday After Party would be just starting to heat up. But after a full evening of soaking up culture and art, I was ready to head back home.</p>\n<p>By midnight, I had only managed to fit in four of the 36 great events happening that night. I hope to go back this week to catch some of the venues I missed.

However, your apartment isn’t just a place to crash—it&#8217;s your home. And every home feels livelier and friendlier with a little greenery. If you don’t consider yourself a Green Thumb, don’t be intimidated—there are voluminous solutions even for the serial plant killers out there!</p>\n<p>Here are just a few ways to bring the beauty of nature into your living space with this selection of some of the finest and easiest plants for your high-rise apartment at 300 Main.</p>\n<h3>Cacti</h3>\n<p>If you love variety, cacti are the way to go. Cacti are available in all sorts and in an abundance of shapes and sizes, making them the perfect plant to help your apartment look “sharp.”</p>\n<p>The upkeep of cacti is as simple as it gets. These easy-to-care-for plants can endure the desert, so if you have a window available, it is more than likely your apartment will be an equally equipped environment to provide these plants with everything they need to thrive. These prickly fellas only need to be watered weekly and need at least four to five hours of direct sunlight a day. Placing them on a window sill will ensure their proper growth—and you’re out of the prick zone!</p>\n<h6><em>Quick Tip:</em></h6>\n<p>During our sub-zero months here in Winnipeg, take care not to place your cacti right up against a window. Choose a higher table or stand by a window to ensure your cacti are still receiving sunlight but able to bask in your heated apartment.</p>\n<h3>Succulents</h3>\n<p>Succulents are resilient, low maintenance, and come in a variety of structures and colors, making them ideal candidates for your own planted arrangement! While succulents do enjoy light, think of them as small children at the beach: Watch that they’re not in direct sunlight for long periods of time (for example, on a window sill). Contrary to common belief, these colorful beings do not thrive when met with scorching temperatures and full-on sun exposure. Succulents need a deep watering once a week during their active growth period, but do not mistake this for drowning the vibrant plant.</p>\n<p>Indoor succulent pots do not require a drainage hole because they should never be watered so much that water leaks from the base. This attribute makes them the perfect plants to put in a hanging pot. You can let their greenery reach the highest of corners of your apartment for an aesthetically pleasing display; or consider showcasing your succulents in a terrarium. A terrarium is a fun addition to your apartment décor.</p>\n<h3>Mint Plants</h3>\n<p>You don’t need your own garden to harvest herb—mint plants flourish indoors. Place these minty seedlings on a window sill in your kitchen (or a window sill of your preference) and water them</p>\n<p>four times a week. This may seem like a hassle, but once a mint leaf has fully blossomed, you can snip it off and throw it into your tea or add some fresh flavour to an old recipe.</p>\n<h3>Basil Plants</h3>\n<p>Like mint, basil plants grow well indoors. Plop them next to your mint plants on the window sill, water every three to four days, and you’ve got your own herb garden in the making. Just like mint, basil leaves are a great resource to have in your kitchen. Chop fresh basil into your sauces or sprinkle onto your homemade pizzas. A little bit of basil tastes great in soups and stews, too.</p>\n<h6><em>Quick Tip for Mint and Basil Plants:</em></h6>\n<p>You can purchase fully-grown mint and basil plants at any local garden centre, or you can buy the seeds and grow them yourself. For the latter option, be prepared to wait two weeks before you see growth above the soil line. When you do see your own little plants popping up, the waiting will pay off!</p>\n<h3>Aloe Vera</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking for a plant with function, look no further than aloe. It may be an odd-looking plant, but it provides a useful balm that is handy for sunburns and scrapes. Of additional value, aloe helps purify your stuffy apartment air.</p>\n<p>It thrives in moist soil, so be sure to water it regularly and give it plenty of bright, indirect light.</p>\n<h3>Bamboo Plants</h3>\n<p>If the spaces near your windows are becoming crowded, consider a bamboo branch. Bamboo plants only need water and shade to survive, making them ideal houseplants for hallways, corners of rooms or areas that lack sunlight at all hours of the day.</p>\n<p>If your newly purchased bamboo plant is at the initial phases of its growth, water the young plant twice a week for the first six months. For an aged bamboo plant, watering every seven to ten days will be enough to keep your bamboo nourished and healthy.</p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2518 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Indoor Plant, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Plants\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-768x960.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-1370x1713.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Fiddle-leaf Fig Trees</h3>\n<p>The upkeep of a fiddle-leaf fig tree is a bit trickier, but not so much that you shouldn’t enjoy its essence in your home. A fig tree is not unlike an angst-filled teenager: Give it space when needed!</p>\n<p>Place a fiddle-leaf fig tree at least five feet away from a window. This should be a space in your apartment where sun rays will hit it, but not constantly throughout the day. The watering routine will depend on the moistness of the soil. Touch the soil and if it is still wet from its last watering five days ago, leave it alone. The tree only needs to be watered when the top few inches of the soil are dry; then it’s time to give your plant a drink.</p>\n<h6><em>Quick tip:</em></h6>\n<p>Just like teenagers, fiddle-leaf fig trees have growth spurts. If you purchase the fig tree when it is just budding, expect rapid growth in the beginning. Fiddle-leaf fig trees grow as tall as six feet, but in most cases, the plant tops at four feet while indoors. If you have low ceilings in your apartment, you can trim the leaves to accompany your space.</p>\n<h3>Anthurium</h3>\n<p>If you are looking to add a pop of colour in your space, anthurium is the perfect indoor flower for apartment living. This flower can tolerate all types of light but will grow best with bright, indirect light. If you have a window with a constructed view of the sun or a surface close enough to a source of light, these are ideal locations for anthurium.</p>\n<h3>Enjoy your Urban Jungle!</h3>\n<p>Indoor pants help transform a space into a home. Adding plants is literally adding life to your home! Being intentional about bringing nature into your space will make your downtown apartment an oasis of rest from the hustle and bustle of urban living.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Between your 9-5 job, Tuesday Yoga classes and drinks with that online date, plant upkeep is at the back of your mind.

Located in Peg Beer Co.’s previous location behind the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, Nonsuch had a soft opening during <a href=\"http://nuitblanchewinnipeg.ca/\">Nuit Blanche</a>, exhibiting dozens of golden umbrellas on its ceiling, illuminated by just as many light bulbs. The room is tastefully decorated with black walls, so-comfy-you-sink-in-them sofas, and modern furniture. The vibe is very relaxed, perfect for both groups and couples.</p>\n<p>Everything on their menu is $7: every beer, ranging from a Belgian blonde to a Baltic porter, is $7 (those with a higher ABV are served in slightly smaller quantity). Nosh on a delicious fruit and nut plate or dig into a massive bowl of popcorn with your choice of dill, chilli pepper, or truffle seasoning.

The bar offers light bites, wine and beer, premium spirits (like mezcal and <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/c/35/japanese-whisky\">Japanese whisky</a>), and great cocktails.

If an establishment has Delirium at all, it’s almost always <a href=\"https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/delirium-tremens/1039/\">Delirium Tremens</a>. Which is why I was so happy to see that in addition to tapas and wine, Cordova also specializes in Belgian beers—complete with the Delirium sign hanging above the bar! My ecstasy at finding Delirium Nocturnum in Winnipeg aside, Cordova is also a fabulous spot for a nightcap.</p>\n<p>They have an extensive wine selection, carefully crafted cocktails, and delicious tapas. The candlelit atmosphere makes Cordova the perfect spot for an intimate nightcap over a bottle of wine and shared small plates, and it’s a must-stop for any Belgian beer aficionado.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">Smith</a></h3>\n<p>75 Forks Market Rd<br />\nMonday to Thursday, 6:30 am to 11 pm<br />\nFriday to Saturday, 6:30 am to 12 am<br />\nSunday, 7 am to 11 pm<br />\n<a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">smithrestaurant.ca</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2056\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2056\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BREdkWXhwJV/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2056\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Winnipeg, Smith Restaurant, Hang out place, Cozy, Lounge\" width=\"940\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-500x325.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-300x195.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-768x498.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @smithwinnipeg on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I realized a few years ago that hotel bars are extremely underrated. They’re usually quiet, relaxed, open late, and offer a great selection of food and drinks and amazing service. Hotel bars just aren’t the first place most people think about when they want to get a drink somewhere! But you don’t need to be a hotel guest to enjoy the hotel bar.</p>\n<p>My favourite hotel bar in the city, and one I’ve been going to for years, is Smith at the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a>. The food is phenomenal, and if you’re not up for a meal, they have a large selection of small plates and sides. (My friends and I usually order a bunch of sides to share.) They have great local beers on tap that rotate regularly, a fantastic wine selection, and some seriously good cocktails. Like, seriously good (try the mezcal and beet cocktail). They have a list of classic cocktails and a list of Smith originals. They even have their own gin! Not to mention the décor is sleek and cosy, and no one is going to bug you if you stay in your <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> blanket booth for hours.</p>\n<h4>So on a cold Winnipeg night, after the Jets have once again made their city proud and you’re craving a nightcap to finish off your evening, try something new! Think of a crisp, locally-brewed beer, a cosy speakeasy, a warm tea cocktail, a juicy glass of wine, and delicious late-night food made by some of Winnipeg’s best kitchens. <a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/\">Downtown Winnipeg</a> has a lot to offer if you know where to look…</h4>\n<p>Have you had a tantalizing nightcap at any of Elena’s favourite spots?

Don’t hide from your culinary creativity because of a mess! Here are five ways to keep your kitchen from looking like a hurricane made landfall in your cupboards.</p>\n<h3>1. Learn to love your Tupperware</h3>\n<p>The dreaded Tupperware cupboard: we all have one. Despite the mysterious lids and tumbling bottoms, tackling this beast doesn’t need to be intimidating. For a smooth post-dinner clean-up, invest in a simple file organizer. Yes—the file organizer on your desk can be put to work in your kitchen, too. Slide lids in one organizer and containers in another to make packing up leftovers a cinch.</p>\n<h3>2. High rise</h3>\n<p>Don’t compromise your charming mug collection just because you’re short on storage. Get the most out of the space you have by thinking vertical! Adding a shelf riser is a quick fix that lets you store more by instantly turning one shelf into two. With all that extra space, why not see what <a href=\"https://www.tinyfeast.com/\">Tiny Feast</a> has in stock to add to your collection?</p>\n<h3>3. Stash away your sprays</h3>\n<p>The cupboard under the sink—also known as the “I’ll just throw it under there” shelf—is an organizing challenge. Finding that one particular kitchen cleaner can be easy with a little creativity: buy a tension rod (the kind you use to hang a shower curtain) and install it under the cupboard. Hook sprays on the rod to create more room on the bottom shelf for “unhangables,” such as garbage bags. For bonus points, pare your collection down to one or two earth-friendly alternatives from <a href=\"http://generationgreenwpg.com/\">Generation Green</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. Double-duty backsplash</h3>\n<p>When it comes to organizing your kitchen, don’t let space goes to waste. Lean a square of pegboard against the back wall of your kitchen counter. Simply insert hooks into the board and hang the tools you use most often to keep them handy. This customizable option can be used for measuring cups, spatulas, and even whisks.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_573\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-573\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-573 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hanging Cups, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-1370x2056.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-573\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Calum Lewis from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>5. Stickin’ your spices</h3>\n<p>Cooking a meal can feel intimidating when you’re fumbling through your cabinet of toppling jars, bags, and containers of spices. Head to the nearby dollar store to purchase small glass jars and magnets. With a little bit of hot glue, your made-for-the-counter jars can become fridge magnets. Fill them up with your favourite spices for an easy way to grab cinnamon or oregano while minimizing cabinet clutter.</p>\n<p>Storage spaces and gadgets don’t need to be used the way they were intended to be; with a bit of imagination, you can make your kitchen a welcoming place to whip up your favourite meals!

Did you know we’ve got our own Ukrainian cultural centre and museum at the edge of downtown? Oseredok has two floors of changing exhibits and a gift shop. The exhibits change every four to six weeks, so you can go back frequently to see new things. During my visit, the second floor held a charming array of quilts, pillows and other stitched items of art.</p>\n<p>The staff members I spoke to were friendly and answered all of my questions. The museum is small, so it’s a great place to go when you want a quick visit. And if you’re trying to save your pennies, good news: visiting Oseredok is free of charge!</p>\n<p>The centre also offers a few public workshops each year, including a chance to learn the art of egg painting at Easter time and how to cook food for Ukrainian Christmas.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>Oseredok is located at 184 Alexander Avenue East. Admission is free. Current visiting hours are Monday to Saturday, 10 am to 4 pm. You can check out the museum online at <a href=\"http://oseredok.ca/\">oseredok.ca</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame</a></h3>\n<p>If you decide to visit Oseredok, you might as well make it a two-for-one day! The</p>\n<p>Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame is just steps away, located in the sparkly new <a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Canada Games Sports for Life Centre</a>.</p>\n<p>Here, you can see some of Manitoba’s sports history and learn about our greatest athletes and sporting achievements. This is another small museum that’s perfect for an afternoon visit.</p>\n<p>The current exhibit looks at Manitoba sports through the decades, with a focus on athletes who also served in Canada’s military. This exhibit is to honour the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War. You’ll get the chance to read about our athletes (including Bobby Hull), view a nice array of sports memorabilia, and watch a video or two. The exhibits change about once per year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-623 size-full\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3702.png\" alt=\"Sport Manitoba, Sport for Life Centre\" width=\"710\" height=\"994\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702.png 710w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-500x700.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-214x300.png 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>The museum and the Canada Games Sports Centre for Life are located at 145 Pacific Avenue at the edge of downtown. (Note: there is no entry from Alexander Street)</p>\n<p>Current visiting hours are:</p>\n<p>* Tuesday, Friday and Saturday from 10 am to 4 pm<br />\n* Wednesday and Thursday from 12 pm to 8 pm</p>\n<p>Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for teens and seniors, and just $2 for children 12 and under. You can visit their website at <a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/hall-of-fame\">sportmanitoba.ca/hall-of-fame</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/\">Dalnavert Museum</a></h3>\n<p>My favourite of the three museums I visited is Dalnavert Museum. It’s a Victorian house built in 1895 that was occupied by one-time Manitoba premier <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/hugh-john-personal-and-career/\">Hugh John Macdonald</a>, who was also known for his family relations. (His father was Canada’s first prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm\">John A. Macdonald</a>.) Hugh’s family lived in the home until 1929. It was taken over and turned into a museum in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>You can take guided tours through the building, which shows off Victorian architecture and furnishings. It’s a great spot for history and architecture buffs, and the guides are knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. (Guided tours take 45 minutes to an hour)<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-637\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3756.png\" alt=\"Dalnavert Museum, Historic Site, Ancient, Classic Interior\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756.png 1008w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-500x357.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-300x214.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-768x549.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-960x685.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>My favourite reason for visiting Dalnavert is for the events they run throughout the year, especially at Christmas time!</p>\n<p>The museum has done <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/20/a-christmas-carol-reading\">readings of A Christmas Carol</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2017/12/15/its-a-wonderful-life-a-live-radio-play\">radio play version of It’s a Wonderful Life</a>. You can enjoy the festivities while nibbling baked treats and imbibing hot cider, mulled wine or hot chocolate. This year, they’re hosting several lecture series covering topics including <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/11/4/lecture-series-jane-austen-reading-series\">Jane Austen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/16/charles-dickens-the-man-behind-the-carol\">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/2/victorian-ghost-stories\">Victorian ghosts</a>. I attended a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2016/12/12/clue-at-the-museum\">Clue</a> board game night there last year, which featured talented actors playing out the murder scene in different rooms of the mansion!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If You Go</strong></em></p>\n<p>Dalnavert is located at 61 Carlton Street (south of Broadway). Winter visiting hours are Wednesday to Sunday, 12 pm to 4 pm. The hours change throughout the year, so check their website before you go. Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for students and seniors, and</p>\n<p>$4 for children. To find out what intriguing events they have coming up next, visit <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\">friendsofdalnavert.ca</a></p>\n<p>Important note: because they haven’t changed the original structure of the building, the second and third floors are not wheelchair accessible.</p>\n<h4><strong>These Aren’t The Only Museums Downtown!</strong></h4>\n<p>Oseredok, the Sports Hall of Fame and Dalnavert are just three of downtown Winnipeg’s lesser-known museums. There are others you can visit, such as the <a href=\"http://www.wpgrailwaymuseum.com/home.html\">Winnipeg Railway Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/police/Museum/default.stm\">Winnipeg Police Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg is so full of history, we pass by so many of these cultural gems each day without giving them a second glance. If you want to enjoy everything your downtown home has to offer, make sure to visit them!</p>\n<h4><em>Is your personal favourite missing from this list?

Both have cozy cafes promising your favourite latte, and moody bars serving creative and delicious cocktails. This is just a small taste of what the Exchange has to offer. To get you started, I’ve put together my own list of great things to see and do on both sides of the Exchange.</p>\n<h2>East Exchange Highlights</h2>\n<h3>Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre</h3>\n<p>174 Market Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/home.aspx\">royalmtc.ca</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_534\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-534\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpXpUM7n88L/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-534 size-full\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg.jpg\" alt=\"Sense and Sensibility, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Winnipeg Downtown, Show, Entertainment\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg.jpg 800w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-534\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sense and Sensibility ? by @leifnorman</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Let the red neon light installation (it’s a Winnipeg landmark!) guide you to the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC). The Royal MTC was Canada’s first English Language regional theatre. It was created in 1958 by (then) Artistic Director <a href=\"http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Hirsch%2C%20John%20Stephen\">John Hirsch</a> and General Manager <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/hendry_tb.shtml\">Tom Hendry</a>—the two guys immortalized in the statue out front.</p>\n<p>Every season there are ten plays offered at either the Tom Hendry mainstage or the John Hirsch Warehouse.</p>\n<h3>Centennial Concert Hall</h3>\n<p>555 Main Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall/\">winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/loriwhelan/18158613780/in/photolist-tEBDeW-99y29b-99uRRp-99uSUx-99uRuM-99xZwY-99uU1V-99y1KS-99y2hs-99y2P5-99xZ9m\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/491/18158613780_147200b81f_c.jpg\" alt=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\nWhile it’s true the Brutalist architectural style makes the Centennial Concert Hall a divisive landmark, there’s no denying the importance of this building. The decadent interior hosts not only the <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra</a>, but the <a href=\"https://wnmf.ca/\">New Music Festival</a>, concerts, and a variety of speakers.</p>\n<h3>Manitoba Museum</h3>\n<p>90 Rupert Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/\">manitobamuseum.ca</a></p>\n<p><center><div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-460-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4\">http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4</a></video></div></center>Have you been to the museum lately? It’s changed since your elementary school field trip (though the bison diorama is still there to greet you). The Manitoba Museum offers a variety of exhibits and displays that appeal to kids and adults alike. The Science Gallery on the lower level invites hands-on experiments and race-car construction for kids. Take in a show at the Planetarium while you’re there. Even better, the museum now hosts after-hours events for adults. (Think tours with cocktails!)</p>\n<h3>The Mitchell Block</h3>\n<p>173 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.themitchellblock.ca/\">themitchellblock.ca</a></p>\n<p>Start off your night on a tasty note with dinner at the Mitchell Block. The menu changes frequently, but one thing you can count on is delicious homemade pastas and a warm ambience.</p>\n<p>If you’re wanting something lighter and more casual, the sister restaurant upstairs (<a href=\"https://www.wetanddrydept.com/\">Wet &amp; Dry Dept.</a>) offers cocktails and appetizers.</p>\n<h3>Forth</h3>\n<p>171 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">www.forth.ca</a></p>\n<p>Right next door from The Mitchell Block is Forth. This historic building was carefully renovated and has become one of the nicest spots in Winnipeg since it opened.</p>\n<p>The main floor has a café offering a well-curated menu of small bites to complement the coffee and drink menu. The basement has one of the coziest/moodiest bars in the city and there’s even a rooftop bar open in the evenings (weather permitting). You’ll find a cocktail list that’s more creative than what you might be used to.</p>\n<h3>Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park</h3>\n<p>Sometimes going for a walk is the best way to fall in love with an area. Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park bookend the East Exchange and offer lush greenspace and a way to “get away” without really going anywhere.</p>\n<h2>West Exchange Highlights</h2>\n<h3>Artspace Building</h3>\n<p>100 Arthur Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://art-space.ca/\">art-space.ca</a></p>\n<p>Like an apartment building with a bunch of cool tenants, this building is home to a diverse group of arts and culture organizations that make Winnipeg a better place.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://platformgallery.org/\">PLATFORM: Centre for Photographic + Digital Arts</a> to <a href=\"http://www.videopool.org/\">Video Pool</a>, you could spend a lot of time wandering Artspace’s halls.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out what <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/cinematheque/\">Cinematheque</a> is showing.</p>\n<h3>Old Market Square</h3>\n<p><span class=\"tribe-street-address\">133 Albert Street</span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/\">exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_556\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-556\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BoXeHtRHBDs/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-556\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Nuit Blanche, Old Market Square, The Cube, Exchange District, Downtown\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-768x959.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nuit Blanche at the Cube, Old Market Square by Liz Tran</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>It may seem like this patch of greenspace in the middle of the Exchange is too small to be a destination, but during the summer it&#8217;s a hub for music, drama and the arts.</p>\n<p>In June, the TD Winnipeg International <a href=\"https://www.jazzwinnipeg.com/\">Jazz Festival</a> hosts free outdoor stage concerts. In July, the <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfringe.com/\">Winnipeg Fringe Festival</a> and the <a href=\"https://srfwpg.blogspot.com/\">Soca Reggae Festival</a> take the stage. In August you can enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.memefest.ca/\">Manitoba Electronic Music Festival</a>. Between these events you’ll see plenty of people making use of the space and making Old Market Square a central location for hanging out downtown.</p>\n<h3>Boutique Anya</h3>\n<p>88 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.boutiqueanya.com/\">boutiqueanya.com</a></p>\n<p>Stop by this stylish and minimalist boutique to pick up something to wear for your night out.

What could be better than enjoying a glass of wine and a few one-bite dishes with friends?</p>\n<h3>Natural Cycleworks</h3>\n<p>91 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"http://naturalcycle.ca/cycleworks/\">naturalcycle.ca/cycleworks</a></p>\n<p>Down the flight of stairs at 91 Albert Street you’ll find one of the best bike shops in the city. This worker co-op (the people who work there also own it) has been around for a long time—and they know bikes. Natural Cycleworks offers full bike service year-round, custom built bikes, and is committed to recycling and resource conservation. With all those fancy new bike lanes in our downtown, this is your place to get geared up for a ride.</p>\n<p>Living downtown provides you quick access to Winnipeg’s vibrant arts and culture scene.

And it’s a well-deserved crown. The Jets have earned a reputation as being one of the best teams in the <a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/\">National Hockey League</a>. With young stars such as Patrik Laine, Nikolaj Ehlers, Mark Scheifele, Kyle Connor and Connor Hellebuyck making headway, this can’t-miss team has been drawing not only national, but world-wide attention for their fast and fluid style of hockey.</p>\n<p>It’s an expensive night out if you plan on taking a date to a Winnipeg Jets game, but it’s usually worth it. In the heart of downtown, there’s no bigger gem than the beautiful Bell MTS Place. Built in 2004 and standing on the former Eatons site, the arena is owned by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, a company which also owns the Winnipeg Jets. They put out a product that is highly entertaining to watch night in and night out; you’ll leave with no regrets.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has a long and rich history of being a serious-minded hockey town, dating back to the early days of the sport when the Winnipeg Victorias won three Stanley Cups in the early 1900’s. Later, in 1920, the Winnipeg Falcons (a team of Icelanders from the West End of town) captured the first-ever Olympic gold medal in ice hockey. It’s only fitting that Winnipeg would erect an enormous hockey arena and stadium right in the centre of its downtown. You can’t be a downtown Winnipegger without taking in at least one Jets game this season.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/recreation-services/duckworth-centre/index.html\">University of Winnipeg—Duckworth Centre</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sangudo/8439115766/in/photolist-dRJF6Y-9Y9KHn-8N7bE8-pVgMqQ-qiT7fm-8dzhLc-owCXRK-9zXNdZ-5WvkZg-ouZHKh-p1RBK8-GsTV7z-q2LE7K-asqBwD-qcz3eT-a1udwZ-ox6TwZ-9Y9D7H-q2uqwa-qaCqU7-9XTmYj-FoWbn-RVuq7V-ofzeaT-q2NkLa-odPGow-FtxtW2-q2Nzve-q2u6Za-qKB2un-oeZ38t-qj3q7e-6TjfKJ-89DAkC-pnaM8a-bHRS2T-pmW7io-6TepQT-oy9MRD-8CAxv7-pmXsGs-pnc2Mt-6TiMnJ-ouCk85-6K5hs2-qcqveo-owqCk4-YoJBW6-pnrSnh-KCiTZW\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8439115766_bcb1f4d59b.jpg\" alt=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>At the University of Winnipeg campus on Portage Avenue you’ll find the beautiful Duckworth Centre, home to the University of Winnipeg’s Wesmen basketball and volleyball teams.

It’s within walking distance of downtown at 400 Spence Street and is a stop on most of the major bus routes (should the weather be frigid).</p>\n<p>Duckworth Centre is the University of Winnipeg’s premiere athletic facility. It features a large gymnasium which includes volleyball and basketball courts, a fitness centre with an indoor running/walking track, multiple racquetball/squash/handball courts, saunas, and much more.

It’s one of the oldest curling clubs in the world and certainly the oldest in Western Canada.</p>\n<p>Affectionately known to curling fans as the &#8220;Mother Club&#8221;, the Granite has produced countless Canadian and world champions. The original Granite Curling Club dates all the way back to 1880. In its current downtown location, the Tudor-framed clubhouse was built in 1913 and is recognized as an official historic site of Manitoba. It is often considered to be the &#8220;St. Andrews&#8221; of curling because of its contribution to the sport in curling&#8217;s mecca.</p>\n<p>If you have a free winter evening and you’re a sports fan looking for something to do, stop on by the Granite and have a drink, watch some curling and have a good time! If you like what you see, sign up for a league and try out the game for yourself. Did you know curling is making a comeback and is one of the fastest growing sports in the prairies? Join the enthusiasm and wrangle in some friends to join a team with you.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/\">Winnipeg Goldeyes—Shaw Park</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/evilfoo/19716053528/in/photolist-w3eVPo-6Lnbv7-cGQoXf-cGQpeC-6ywTJt-cGQptu-eBz8S2-cGQmW3-cGQnwJ-4T86bw-MKkv3-59mv7D-574iVb-p9LAMF-4Amjpk-V5WJFu-o9oecJ-6DWAb5-7GFGnk-cGQiXj-6KrUpV-7mFcWn-oqT3gB-85wggY-cGQq6Q-orFMTB-cFrA7f-a5NTq8-cGQpGQ-6KvYBw-adpH4a-9VC2vz-6KrSQz-6KrXSz-6Ks4HX-22B4uKP-6y8QEt-6KrYkM-56Z8Gx-cGQqUN-6xRZqe-6vJdFJ-3gfQAA-5jGq55-eCVFG6-6KwyN7-21wkAEy-orFMLH-ac8fPj-2kB35B\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/427/19716053528_cdc55240db_b.jpg\" alt=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" width=\"1024\" height=\"311\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>It’s hard to think of a better summertime sports option than watching a Winnipeg Goldeyes game over at Shaw Park. When tickets can be had for as little as $9, it’s a no-brainer for an evening of fun. Centrally located, adjacent to <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> (local beers and snacks of every ethnicity) and across the street from the <a href=\"http://Canadian Museum for Human Rights\">Canadian Museum for Human Rights</a>, you could even make a whole-day excursion out of a Goldeyes Game.</p>\n<p>While Winnipeggers (understandably) tend to fixate on the Jets and their standings, let’s take a moment to point out that the Goldeyes are one of the better baseball teams in the American Association, winning two league championships in the past three years. Even if you’re not an outspoken baseball fan, it’s worth your time just to see former MLB slugger Reggie Abercrombie hit some homeruns for the Goldeyes.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered why they’re called the Goldeyes, anyway? Here’s a piece of sports trivia: The club is named after the goldeye, a fish often served as a smoked delicacy and commonly called Winnipeg Goldeye. So why not take in a Goldeyes’ game and then smoke up some goldeye when you get back to your apartment after the game? That’s the make of a true Winnipegger.</p>\n<p>That’s only the beginning of the list of downtown stops for Winnipeg sports enthusiasts. Comment on your favorite spot for sports in downtown Winnipeg.

Looking out of your window every morning is your first source of inspiration for your downtown apartment décor! <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Let me give you a few more sources of inspiration. Here are <em><b>seven easy tips to decorate your apartment with style.</b></em></p>\n<h3><b>1. Decide what you want to say through the interior design of your apartment</b>.</h3>\n<p>Our houses show the world who we are just as our clothing does. It is said, “Dress to impress. Dress for success.” I would also say, “Dress up your house so people can know who you are and what you’re about.” I love looking at the small details of someone’s home. Books on shelves, pictures on walls, and decor from foreign countries can tell a lot about the dweller. How do you want people to feel or what do you want them to know about you when they walk into your apartment? “He must be a musician, I see sheet music all around and a guitar right there in the corner”; or “I love those strict and simple lines of his furniture. He must be a pragmatic and realistic person.” When I lived in a small studio in downtown Winnipeg, I placed an open easel right beside the window along with oil colors and canvases. I didn&#8217;t have to say a single word to my guests about who I am or what I value. They could see a creative woman living in that studio just because an easel was a part of the interior.</p>\n<p><center> <a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/514888169892992854/\"></a> </center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Minimalism, modern, boho…step number two is to <b>decide on the style</b>.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>There are many sources of inspiration for new style ideas. However, before you start browsing the internet and designer magazines, make a list of what you like. Try to list colors, shades, lines and textures. Your perfect home—what does it look like? Does it have darker or lighter furniture? Would you prefer surrounding yourself with books, pillows and candles, or do you feel more relaxed in an empty and open space? <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>When your list seems complete, it’s time to start browsing. You need to describe the desired style in one word. Why? Let me give you an example based on minimalistic style. You decided that Scandinavian minimalism makes your heart beat faster. When your eyes rest on perfect wooden details, grey couches, potted plants in nooks and on sills, you are in love. This Scandinavian minimalism will become your base. White, grey and cold dusty blue will be the palette for this minimalistic style. Interior design has the same building techniques as clothing capsule; you will build, add, and create from your base. When you have a strong base, incorporating items and accessories from a different style won’t ruin your look; the spirit of your space will remain the same.</p>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/114630753000986248/\"></a></center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>3. Mix them all up!</b></h3>\n<p>In step two, you’ve done the hard work of finding one style to act as a strong base. Step three is more fun! If you want to add more life, more chic, and a professional-looking vibe to your place &#8211; mix styles. You might have a very simple grey couch in minimalistic style, but the coffee table, rugs, and wall prints are funky in a creative or modern style. Mix modern and classic, urban and traditional; many interior designers use this method. It helps breathe a sense of life into a space.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Add textures.</b></h3>\n<p>Even the most minimalistic person with the most minimalistic interior design would love to cuddle up under a warm throw on a cold winter evening. Texture adds comfort. Look for textured pillows, curtains, blankets and rugs. Textured curtains with a print mounted close to the ceiling can be a great way to add some visual height to apartment walls. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/275634439666792944/\"></a></center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>5. Don’t forget</b><b>memorable pieces or vintage details</b>. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>What I love most about Winnipeg is the antique stores and flea markets. Among other interesting items, I have found 1920’s picture frames, extravagant lamps, and even an umbrella holder. Antique stores and flea markets are full of hidden gems that have the power to make your place look special. We’ve all been in a house or apartment that presents the finest furniture, yet it feels plastic and fake. There is no spirit of home. These houses do not reflect the owner’s vision; on the contrary, those expensive, perfect pieces of furniture only bring with them an impersonal feeling of coldness. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If you, on the other hand, are the owner of a basic, simple couch, what is the trick to making your place look and feel interesting and inviting? Try displaying vintage photo frames with pictures of your happy self or your cat (or better yet&#8211;you with your cat!), or the people most important in your life. If vintage details are not your thing, do the opposite. Allow yourself to splurge on just one unique and funky looking piece of furniture, a piece which will express your style and personality. It might be a sofa chair with curved legs, or a set of bar chairs offering an unusual shape, shade or aesthetic detail. Don’t shy away from bringing interesting pieces into your life. Have fun creatively incorporating into your décor items that are particularly meaningful to you; pieces with history or which have a story to tell.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>6. Add </b><b>color </b><b>accents.</b> <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Living in Winnipeg with its long, cold winters has its effect on our visual appetite. We crave bright colors time after time. The best way to bring more color into your daily life is through intentionally incorporating richly-colored accents and prints into your interior design. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>I love colorful pillows in my living room. When the seasons change, I change my pillows from mustard yellow to crisp, bright blue. Colors make a room look different. (Though I would recommend keeping your walls white or light grey to make the room appear more spacious.) Adding colorful pillows<b> </b>here and there can make any gloomy and snowy day seem better.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>7. Maximize space</b><b>.</b></h3>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/325525879309312118/\"></a></center><br />\nLiving in a smaller space can be challenging in the way of finding storage solutions for your stuff and protecting your place from feeling or becoming overcrowded. Bring more air into any room by minimizing the clutter. Clutter could include things like overloaded piles of papers, too many countertop appliances in the kitchen, or even chairs around a table that are too close to each other. To instantly make your apartment feel more spacious, rearrange furniture pieces so they have at least two steps between them. You’ll be amazed at what this simple trick can do.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If I could leave only one parting tip, it would be this: Don’t be scared to be bold and brave. Life is too short to decorate your home with boring furniture. To prove it, I just purchased a yellow couch. That’s right, a yellow one! And I’m not turning back.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><script async defer src=\"//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js\"></script></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living in a small apartment doesn’t mean your space has to be boring. If you are living in downtown Winnipeg’s Exchange District, you are already surrounded by some of the most historic and beautiful architecture in Western Canada.

Take a moment and peek into your garbage can. For every fruit or vegetable scrap, eggshell, pile of coffee grinds or pizza crust you see, give yourself a point. For this game we’re playing by golf rules: the lower the points, the higher the score. How did you do?</p>\n<p>Food scraps comprise a large portion of Canadian waste-bin space, but they don’t belong there! Don’t let being an apartment dweller prevent you from composting and living your best eco-friendly life.</p>\n<p>Don’t know where to begin? Here are some quick and easy tips on how you can gain your environmental karma back.</p>\n<h4>Worm Bin</h4>\n<p>For most urban renters, a compost bin is probably the best solution. Worm compost bins are one of the most resourceful compost options available for apartment dwellers. The worm method is portable and quick, as worms help process your household waste and produce nutrient-rich “worm-tea”—a beneficial addition to the soil of your household plants.</p>\n<h4><em>DIY Worm Compost Bin</em></h4>\n<p>Purchase a medium to large plastic bin with two lids: one for the top and the other to place under the bottom. Poke a few, scattered holes in the bottom of the bin for drainage, and a few holes in the top of the lid for ventilation. Place the second lid underneath the bin to catch liquid.</p>\n<p>Now onto the wiggly night-crawlers.</p>\n<p>You can purchase worms in various places around Winnipeg: your local garden centre, a vermicomposting facility (<a href=\"http://www.naturesperfectplantfood.com\">www.naturesperfectplantfood.com</a>), or even <a href=\"https://www.kijiji.ca/\">Kijiji</a>, just to name a few. To make the bin feel like home for the worms, soak the bin with water and line the sides and bottom of the bin with shredded newspapers. Lastly, spread a little soil over the paper and plop in those slimy fellas.</p>\n<p>Now that you have prepared the compost bin, you can begin throwing in your food scraps. To avoid odors and to guarantee more efficient composting, be sure to continue adding more damp newspaper strips, leaves and/or dirt along with your scraps.</p>\n<h4>Compost Bin Without the Worms</h4>\n<p>If you’re not fond of worms, you need not include them! Follow the steps above and simply omit the worms; just be prepared for the food to take a bit longer to break down.</p>\n<h4><em>Where to Store your Bin</em></h4>\n<p>Determine the best place for you. Common locations are under the sink, in an infrequently used closet, on the balcony, or even in a window flower box.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_405\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-405\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-405 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1370x913.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-405\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4>Freezer Composting</h4>\n<p>The benefit of keeping compost in your freezer is that you don’t have to worry about maintaining the compost bin and it’s out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>Slide that tub of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream and that freezer-burned hamburger meat to one side to clear up some space.

Go ahead and throw those egg shells, coffee grinds, and fruit peels into the blender, add some water and let it rumble.</p>\n<p>You can easily dispose of this compost smoothie by adding small amounts to the soil of your indoor plants, or by pouring it into a flowerbed or soil patch near your apartment. With the onset of our traditional Winnipeg six-month winters, ask your friends or work colleagues if they have an outdoor compost bin you can use during the snowy months, or contact your local indoor greenhouses/gardens.</p>\n<p>Lastly, have fun with composting! Don’t think of it as a chore. It will soon become routine, just like separating your recycling from the rest of your garbage. You just may inspire your other apartment-dwelling friends and neighbours to take on an eco-friendlier lifestyle.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Food scraps comprise a large portion of Canadian waste-bin space, but they don’t belong there!

You’re in the heart of the city with oodles of entertainment choices right outside your door. In your new digs at 300 Main, you will also have new neighbours, maybe more than you’ve ever had before. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>As adults, we sometimes have trouble making new friends and even introducing ourselves to others. Do you want your neighbours to be more than just nameless faces but don’t know where to start? If so, here are five ideas that just may get you started in meeting those sharing your new living environment. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Join the Gym</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>At 300 Main, you’ve got some swanky new amenities, including a gym. There are many good reasons to use these facilities, the most obvious of which are exercise and healthy living. Yes, you could work out in your apartment, but you won’t meet anyone new there. The gym will give you an opportunity to politely check out and maybe meet some of your neighbours. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1438523886290140&#038;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></center></p>\n<p>It can be easier to introduce yourself to someone in the gym, because you already have something in common: a desire to exercise. This gives you a ready-made topic to discuss. Does your possible new bestie have a favourite piece of equipment or a good workout tip? Starting with this type of safe topic gives you a chance to chat and discover if you might have more in common. If they don’t seem like buddy material, stick to your short exercise chat, then go back to working out. Having exercise to do gives you an easy excuse to extract yourself from a conversation that isn’t going well. (The introverted among us always like having an escape plan from awkward conversation.) Remember, less is more. You don’t want to be the pushy type, so don’t monopolize anyone for too long.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If your first conversation goes well, you can try to catch this person on the regular at the gym for a while. If you both seem receptive to talking outside of the gym, suggest going for drinks or coffee, something comfortable and short.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Friends-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-1370x913.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>Join a Social Event or Start a Social Committee</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-225\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-500x374.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-300x224.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-768x574.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1370x1024.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />Does your building hold any social events onsite or organize any group outings? If yes, consider joining one that interests you. If you don’t see any options for social gatherings, consider starting a social committee yourself. You will likely need to talk to building management first, but group outings are another great way to meet people in low-stress situations and see if you have something in common.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>You can also join or start a charitable endeavour in your building. There are many non-profit organizations located downtown, such as<i> Siloam Mission</i><i> </i>or<i> Welcome Place</i>, which have volunteer openings.  Alternatively, you could invite your apartment block or floor to raise money as a community. Organizations like the Christmas Cheer Board are always looking for new donors. Any of these options will create an opportunity for you to meet people and help a worthy cause at the same time. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Start a Conversation in Common Areas</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Inevitably, you will see some of your new neighbours in the hall, on the elevator or in the mailroom. One of the easiest ways to meet your neighbours is to pipe up and introduce yourself in these situations. If you’re an extrovert, starting conversations with complete strangers is likely an easy task for you. If you’re an introvert, this will take more effort. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Start with a smile and avoid coming on too strong. Remember, you’ve already got something in common: you live in the same building! Ask what they think of the building, the gym or some other amenity. This should lead to an easy conversation. Chances are good you can converse on this topic for a few minutes, which is all you will have (at most) when you randomly run into people in your building. Remember to give your name and, if you feel comfortable, what floor you live on. You won’t hit it off with every neighbour, so don’t fret if the first few conversations don’t work out. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Advanced Technique</b><b>: Throw a Party!</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>If you’re a sociable sort and like to plan events, consider throwing a party. This might be especially welcome if everyone on the invitee list is new to the building, since most of us like to make friends. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>It’s best to invite a smallish number of people to a party, maybe everyone on your floor. You can knock on doors, leave messages under doors or invite people you’ve met and with whom you have already exchanged numbers.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Keep the event low key and don’t try to make people do party games. Be conscientious and keep the volume down. Not everyone will come and you don’t want to tick off the people who share your building. The party could just be an easy brunch (mimosas!) or after work drinks. You don’t have to plan for a six-hour event. If all goes well, you might make a few friends.

You can visit the Millennium Library or sign up for some volunteer work in your neighbourhood. There are so many options for meeting people downtown.

The truth is, many people are shy and just need an invitation to strike up a conversation.  Before long, you’ll discover that “renters” have become “neighbours”, and “neighbours” have become friends. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Downtown living can be exciting.

Quaintly nestled within the large historic buildings of the downtown area, some of these shops are easy to miss if you don’t know where to look. Those with an eye for fashion might want to keep an eye out for these hidden fashion boutiques downtown and in the Exchange District.</p>\n<h3>Lennard Taylor</h3>\n<p>246 McDermot Avenue<br />\nSince 2015</p>\n<p>This clothing store bears the name of its young designer. A boutique fashion house that designs and produces its own high-quality clothing for women, there is even opportunity at the back of the store for interested shoppers to watch how the clothing is produced. The style is both classic and modern at the same time; comfortable business wear or elevated casual wear. Lennard Taylor invites custom work and offers pieces of original art for sale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lennardtaylor.com/\">www.lennardtaylor.com</a></p>\n<h3>Flaunt Boutique</h3>\n<p>106-270 Waterfront Drive<br />\nSince 2014</p>\n<p>This store is located on the first floor of one of the condo buildings on Waterfront Drive and is a worthwhile destination for those who value a unique fashion find. Flaunt Boutique is a new business venture for De Luca’s co-owner Kate Holden, showcasing clothing, shoes, handbags, and accessories for women. Every piece of merchandise is exclusive to their shop; these products are not available at any other location in</p>\n<p>Winnipeg. It’s a compelling stop for evening and party wear, or to reinvent your look with a unique accessory or piece of jewellery.</p>\n<p>www.shopflaunt.ca</p>\n<h3>Livestock Winnipeg</h3>\n<p>407 Graham Avenue<br />\nSince 2017</p>\n<p>On my first attempt to check out this shop, I completely missed it and kept walking. That’s a tribute to how hidden it is. This store is located at 407 Graham Avenue and is the thirds of its chain to open in Canada, following a store in Vancouver and another in Toronto. Livestock specializes in sneakers and modern streetwear. It’s unquestionably a top stop for the sneakerhead, or for anyone on a serious hunt for a pair of fashionable sneakers. Livestock Winnipeg carries men’s/unisex clothing in-store and a smaller selection of women’s clothing online.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deadstock.ca/\">www.deadstock.ca</a></p>\n<h3>Boutique Anya</h3>\n<p>88 Albert St.<br />\nSince 2015</p>\n<p>This little shop is locally owned and operated by designer Alicja Dalecki. It carries a curated collection of contemporary women’s clothing, housewares, statement jewelry, and environmentally-aware cosmetics. Created by both local and international designers, Boutique Anya’s products favour a minimalist design crafted from natural materials. You’ll find something unique, natural and beautiful here&#8230;and off the beaten track</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.boutiqueanya.com/\">www.boutiqueanya.com</a></p>\n<p>So forget the congestion of the mall and the monotony of shopping at another box store.

Josh, better known amongst his peers as “@yoshigrams”, is dangling his feet from a rooftop in the historic Exchange District awaiting the first signs of light. His mission on this crisp September morning is to capture the first beams of sunlight as they rise to cascade over the array of brick buildings set in Chicago style. The aged brick buildings proudly display the remnants of hand painted ads and signs from years past. These ghosted-signed walls will serve as today’s backdrop. Sitting outside in the brisk weather patiently waiting for the sun’s first light is a small price to pay for the stunning photo he will capture today through the lense of his trusty and well-loved camera.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Josh is not alone in his mission to capture the city’s downtown core and the people calling it home. This group of talented and creative Winnipeg photographers, whether they know it or not, is quickly changing the way in which we view our city of just over 700,000 residents. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>For many, downtown Winnipeg has become a focal point and hub for photography thanks in part to its diverse cityscapes and character. A mix of late 1800s Chicago-style architecture that inhabits the Exchange, along with sporadic growth and revitalization in the downtown core, have all played a part in this resurgence of interest. New projects and spaces like <a href=\"http://www.truenorthsquare.com/\">True North Square</a>, <a href=\"https://humanrights.ca/\">Museum of Human Rights</a>, and the renovation of the <a href=\"https://www.wcc.mb.ca/\">Winnipeg Convention Centre</a> have captured the imagination of many–tourists and Winnipeggers alike. This diverse area encompasses approximately 179.18 square miles and is enjoyably explored on foot or bicycle. One can cover a large portion of the downtown area in a 15-minute bike ride or 20-minute walk from Portage and Main; that is all the distance separating the <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/eat-and-drink/dine/the-common\">Commons at the Forks Market</a> from the steps of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a> or the heart of the Exchange and Provencher Bridge.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_251\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-251\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-251 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Provencher-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-1024x576.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-768x432.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher.png 1267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Joe Lu</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>To what do we attribute this influx and growth of interest in photography? We could sit around and debate the influence of good-quality and accessible entry-level camera gear, the evolution of the cell phone camera, or the popularity of photo sharing apps like Instagram and VSCO. While these all come into play, I think there’s something bigger and deeper at the heart of it all. I see a vast number of up-and-coming photographers with a yearning for adventure who are finding it all in their own backyard: Downtown Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_264\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-264\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkDJcrRh9sw/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-264\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-264\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Mike Peters @93mp</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>This growing talent pool have proven their ability to capture the same city and locations in contrasting and unique shooting and editing styles. I can’t help but think that this friendly competition is the reason we are seeing such imagery evolving. While some may choose to shoot strictly on iPhones and others prefer investing in higher-end DSLRs, the well of creativity does not run dry. From romanticized skylines to whimsical street views. the variety of ways we can view our city has never been as interesting, as beautiful, or as diverse. This wave of both established and up-and-coming artists are transforming the mundane streets and views into beautiful works of art, ready to be hung on gallery and condo walls alike. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>And it is not just the aesthetic quality these photos possess, but the way in which they engage the viewer. Sometimes a familiar space is seen in a new light or a recommendation unintentional is offered. Leveraging tools like social media have forged new paths for us to journey along with photographers as they explore the downtown. Thanks to apps like VSCO and Instagram, we find ourselves consistently screenshotting images taken by some of our favourite Winnipeg photographers. It might be a simple reminder to order a print or, even more often, a reminder to add a specific location to our “To Do and See” list.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>On my phone amongst the clutter is an album labelled “To Do and See.” I enjoy photography, though I am far from accomplished; perhaps even labelling it a “hobby” is a statement of generosity.  But in the interests of inspiring other local, amateur photographers to grab their camera of choice and hit the pavement for adventure, I took a minute to map out one of my recent excursions.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_280\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRHsmeHAepw/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-280\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-768x959.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Manny Berkal-Sarbit @leggrease</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>From the steps of 300 Main, camera in tow, I hang a right and walk the 7 minutes to Via Rail Union Station to marvel at the building interior. I have been here before, but years ago when I did not have the appreciation I do now. Not many people know that the Historic Building built in 1908 through 1909 was designed by Warren and Wetmore, architects of New York’s Grand Central Station.  A few years back, an image of this space captured by Josh helped me to appreciate the intricate workings of the inner dome-shaped ceiling. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>I keep moving. Depending on the time of year and day, it looks like I am heading west to grab a couple of photos at Upper Fort Garry Park. I have driven by on a weekly basis for many years, yet I desire to take it in first-hand.  It’s hard to believe that more than 400 feet of steel and light went into the installation that scribe three continuous lines tracing the history of western Canada and of <a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/\">Upper Fort Garry</a>. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Time for some refreshment. I am sitting down for a drink at the Sky Lounge behind Hotel Fort Garry. Sky Lounge offers a stunning skyline view overlooking downtown and the Forks and is located just a few floors from Prairie 360, with views of the city in its entirety. If the day was still young I may rather have opted to grab a coffee at <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools + Horses</a> en route to lunch, served up on Broadway courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.theredember.com/\">Red Ember Food</a> truck just a block west from <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools + Horses</a>.  <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>At this point I have a few options. Option one, I can cross the street and do a self-guided tour of the Manitoba Legislative Building, hoping to adequately capture the extensive masonry work and do my best to make out the Hermetic Code written in stone (literally). Option two, I can walk up a block to hit the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/\">WAG</a>’s rooftop terrace or walk to the top of The Bay parkade across the street. These are some of the greatest vantage points of downtown and all it has to offer.

There I will capture some street scenes reminiscent of Chicago, some ghost signs that decorate the building landscape, and then stop for a bite at either <a href=\"https://www.kingandbannatyne.com/\">King + Bannatyne</a> or <a href=\"http://www.deerandalmond.com/\">Deer + Almond</a> before seeing who or what I can capture at the the Cube Stage in Old Market Square. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_267\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj2RcGZnbR9/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-267\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Mike Peters @93mp</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>My last route will be Waterfront Drive, making my way Southeast to capture <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/\">Shaw Park</a> with the arches of Provencher Street Bridge in the background. My final stop will be the ever-popular Museum of Human Rights. All said and done, I will have covered a good portion of downtown Winnipeg–Broadway–Assiniboine, South Portage, the Exchange District, Waterfront and the Forks. I will leave Central Park and Chinatown for my next adventure.

When the city of Winnipeg refocused its vision back to making a beautiful and accessible downtown, Winnipeggers took note.
