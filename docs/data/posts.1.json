Moving can be hard on everyone in your household, not just us, but our pets are much more affected by moving than we may be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animals do have a harder time with moving than us since they don&#8217;t get the luxury of being able to mentally prepare as we do for something as big as moving to a new home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Think Ahead</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to try and make a move as easy as possible for your feline friend, who can be particularly sensitive when it comes to moving. The best thing you can do is start by thinking ahead. Sometimes we don&#8217;t always get to plan everything, but moving with animals, when possible, the earlier you get yourself and your pets ready, the easier it will be on everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to try and keep our pets in mind a couple of weeks before the moving day if that&#8217;s possible in your situation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg\" alt=\"Cat inside a box\" class=\"wp-image-9901\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Packing up your house can be hard on your cat, so you want to get them used to the process early. Luckily, this can also be fun for your pet with your help. We all know that as soon as there&#8217;s an empty box, cats will be in it or trying to be. After all, the saying goes, &#8220;if I fit, I sit, right&#8221;? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let them have some fun by leaving a couple of empty boxes around where you are packing, so it gets them used to the action and it gives them something to play with. You get bonus points if you want to cut holes in the sides of the boxes to really provide them with something to have fun with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that you can do to get your cat ready for moving out is to have a dedicated kitty-corner set up for them a couple of weeks in advance, so they already have a safe space when moving day comes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat sleeping in a box\" class=\"wp-image-9902\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing to remember is that the transition can only go as smoothly as you help make it. With a bit of preparation and thinking ahead, you can help make this transition as smooth as possible for your cat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting The Old Place Ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If it is possible, it&#8217;s best to have an area or a room set up for your cat that is comfortable and will be packed last. Set this area up with stuff for your cat to help make moving easier on them. This should include their kennel, bed, food, water, litter box, cat furniture, and toys. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives them a safe and comfortable spot to be away from the stress of moving. You want to set this room up a few weeks in advance and keep it accessible to your cat, so when you must keep them in there on moving day, they will be able to be comfortable and hopefully happy to spend some time in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Cat sleeping on a cozy bed\" class=\"wp-image-9903\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2.jpg 1225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Things to include in the room:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Toys</li><li>Blankets &amp; Bed</li><li>Kennel</li><li><a href=\"https://www.petvalu.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Food, Water &amp; Treats</a></li><li>Litter box</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If a cozy cat room isn&#8217;t an option, then you can still prepare by getting the carrier you&#8217;re going to be moving them in, setting up a couple of weeks ahead of time, and giving them a little section of the house with their kennel, toys, food, and litter. This gives your cat a safe spot to go to when things around them are being packed and moved and gets them comfortable with the idea of being in their carrier when it comes time for them to be in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting The New Place Ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving out is one thing to consider, but it&#8217;s important to make sure you take just as much care with making your kitty comfortable with the new place as it is moving out of the old one. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-1024x617.jpg\" alt=\"Cat chilling on a furniture\" class=\"wp-image-9904\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-300x181.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-770x464.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-293x176.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-500x301.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-100x60.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-149x90.jpg 149w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3.jpg 1104w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A new environment can be a lot for anyone to take in, especially our animals.

If you can, it&#8217;s best to set up a safe area at the new place, too, and take your cat over there to explore the empty house first. This makes it a little less stressful having to spend some time in there while you do the heavy lifting and unpacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would preferably be a room or section of the house or apartment that you can move your cat into with its comfort items and will be set up for its actual use last. Keep your kitty comfy in this area while you set up the house. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let them Explore</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are ready to let your cat explore their newly set up environment, make sure you hold off on taking apart the moving room and try to keep their safe space available for the first little while until they are more comfortable in the new place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat exploring a new room\" class=\"wp-image-9905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1.jpg 1094w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Things to include in the room:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You pretty much want to include whatever you had set up at the old place or to include the same kind of items that you have set up at the old place.

It is our retreat, where we relax and recharge. Being one of the focal points of our homes, many of us strive to create the &#8216;perfect&#8217; bedroom. But when it comes to designing our bedrooms, it can be hard to know where to start. What do you need, what should you think of, are you forgetting anything, what is considered &#8220;the best&#8221; bedroom set up anyways?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom2-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7931\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom2.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no exact formula for the best bedroom when designing the perfect bedroom because each space, personality, and lifestyle is different, and you have to do your best with what you can do. When living in a rental property, it may seem like it isn&#8217;t much you can do if you are limited by not being able to paint or change too much. You can turn any space into the perfect bedroom with a few key tips, no matter your bedroom situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors &amp; Textures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the overall aesthetic design of your bedroom, you want to consider your colors and textures first. If you are planning to paint, make sure you choose your colors carefully and consider the color scheme of one of the next major features in the room, like your bedding or rug.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7932\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to go with<a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Ideas/Popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> colors that complement each other</a> without being overbearing. If you already have a common color throughout the room, you might want to choose one that compliments the things you already have. You want to go with colors that are the more neutral, darker, or lighter tones than the colors you will be working with; this compliments your bright colors without using the same ones and being too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For textures, you want to be mindful that you are adding the right ones, but you want to avoid having too many. Textures include things like your rug, pillows, blankets, and patterns. These are all things that have and create their texture, and you want to make sure you choose the same or complementary and not add too many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7929\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t painting, having white walls in your bedroom is a great way to trick the eye into feeling like the space is bigger than it is. If you have a smaller space, it might be better to go with white to make the space feel larger, whereas, in a small room, the wrong or too many colors can make the space feel cramped.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Having the right Frame in Mind</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to consider is your<a href=\"https://www.structube.com/en_ca/furniture/bedroom?page=1&amp;sort-by=position-asc&amp;category_id%5Bfilter%5D=Beds%2C503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> bed frame</a>. If you will be getting a new bed frame, it is essential to think about the space and what you need when choosing one.

There are many great places to go fishing. Whether you want to make the day or weekend of it, fishing in Manitoba is another must-do. When it comes to the best fishing spots, there is somewhere to go in any part of the province and cities that make it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Father and son walking with fishing gear towards a lake\" class=\"wp-image-7905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are going to try and make the most of fishing in Manitoba, you can quickly turn your plans into a day or weekend trip. With many of our best hot spots being within 10 to 45 minutes of not only Winnipeg but each other, you can easily plan either a day or weekend of fishing throughout Manitoba this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about these Manitoba attractions is they have much more to offer than a great catch. All of these beautiful views have much more to offer, like hiking, trail walking, resorts, casinos, restaurants, and so much more. No matter what you like to do when you get away, get away to these favorite Manitoba destinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hiking, Beaches, and More Nature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another fun Manitoba getaway idea is to take a shorter trip to one, or more of these Manitoba gems, no matter what you feel like doing. These spots are famous for their nature to see, trails to blaze, and beaches to laze.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Birds Hill Park</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/park-maps-and-locations/central/birds.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Birds Hill Park</a> is a great stop or destination for a day trip. With multiple walking and hiking trails, an artificial beach, and lots of great ways to enjoy nature within 30 minutes of Winnipeg. If you are stopping at Bird&#8217;s Hill Park, you want to make sure you visit the very beautiful and famous Pine Ridge Hollow for dinner or drinks. Pineridge is a unique restaurant experience, with its own local crafty gift shop and goats to pet; it is one of my favorite things to include in any trip to rural Manitoba.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lockport</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Located just at the end of Henderson Highway within 45 minutes from Winnipeg is Lockport. Lockport holds a high reputation for its fishing and diners, making it a great all-day experience. Lockport has always been famous for its two vintage diners, Skinners and the Half Moon. While Skinner&#8217;s historic waterslide may be shut down, you can still enjoy Skinners Diner in full swing serving its world-famous foot-long hot dogs and delicious shakes while listening to your table&#8217;s jukebox in its classic 50s themed (more like preserved) diner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Couple drinking milk shake\" class=\"wp-image-7910\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After dinner and less than just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Skinners is the Half Moon drive-in. With delicious food and shakes, and certainly not any less famous than its sister, is this other local legend.

Give her a unique and timeless gift this Mother’s Day by making her the perfect year-round wreath!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ideas out there for this one, from the more traditional to the out of the flower box ideas. This is a very versatile gift idea. These are great because you can tailor them to her taste and decor, and no one knows your mom’s style better than you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fabric wreaths</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your mom is the fun, creative type, this is a perfect choice. Make a wreath that matches whatever space your mom is proudly going to want to display it. A great option is using handkerchiefs and pocket scarves as they are an easy-to-find, affordable, and one-of-a-kind idea when it comes to making a wreath.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"907\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7788\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg 907w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-300x249.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-770x639.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-293x243.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-500x415.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-72x60.jpg 72w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-108x90.jpg 108w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great DIY gift idea you can customize for your mom that she will love is a flower box bouquet. Show your mom not only how much she means to you but how well you know her with a personalized bouquet. Nothing says Happy Mother’s Day like realizing their baby really does know and love them back (almost) as much as they know and love us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show your mom how much you with a personalized bouquet. These personalized DIY bouquets are a perfect fit for Mother’s Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crystal Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or your mom is into crystals, this is a great idea. Not only is it sentimental to put it into a bouquet, but crystals are also incredibly beautiful and personal when it comes from the right person. If your mom likes crystals, the great idea is to go to a holistic store (or order a set on amazon) and pick out a few of your favorite crystals that you know your Mom would love. This is one of the most affordable yet thoughtful ideas when it comes to the DIY gift department.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"927\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7786\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg 927w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure what a crystal is or what to buy, here are some suggestions that fit the energy of Mother’s Day. It is never a bad idea to grab some dried herbs and fresh flowers to throw in and fill the spaces and really make your bouquet complete. You can go to your local metaphysical store or order them online from many holistic realters (amazon included). The great thing about these bouquets is you can make them specific to your mom&#8217;s life, needs, and personality. If you are not quite sure where to start with the crystals and do not want to ruin the surprise by asking her yourself, here are some fail-safe favorites she will definitely love:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Rose Quartz</li><li>Amethyst</li><li>Citrine</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Turquoise</li><li>Clear Quartz</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Rainbow Fluorite</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edible Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another delicious bouquet idea is an edible bouquet! If you ask any mom, they would probably rather have chocolates than actual flowers. A traditional gift like flowers is a nice thought, but they wilt all too soon. Give your Mother’s Day gift a tasty appetizer with a chocolate or cookie bouquet, picked fresh for your own Mom&#8217;s taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7785\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908.jpg 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great and easy thing to pull off, no matter your DIY skill, because baking is optional. Put together some of your mom’s favorite cookies, chocolates, and other treats and arrange them in her own “snack bouquet.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Photo Bouquet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A great bouquet option that you can personalize with your mom is a photo bouquet! Print out some of your favorite photos of your mom or you and her together, and turn them into a personal bouquet! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"778\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7784\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1.jpg 778w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>She will certainly love the thought and personality put behind it and the fact that she has printouts of the two of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DIY Self Care Box</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moms work way too hard even now that we grow older; our moms are still able to grace us with their motherly wisdom at every text and call.

You can find fun ideas and more in-depth instructions online, but making a candle is as easy as 1-2-3-.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pick out your wax, wick, and smell.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The ingredients of a candle are your wax, the wick, the essential oils, and of course, your jar. You can get these online or at any craft store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Prepare</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is melt the wax, mix, and set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melt your wax either directly or through a double boiler system. Once the wax is melted, mix in your essential oils. Whatever method, wax, and size of candle you choose will determine how much you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Package</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that your wax and essential oils are combined, you want to get ready to fill the jar and set the wick. Slowly pour the melted wax and oil into the jar with the wick and let it set. Within 24-48 hours, you will have a personal, beautiful candle ready for your Mother’s Day gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"917\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7781\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg 917w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mom is bound to love any one of these DIY gifts or any other idea you may come up with. When it comes to Mother’s Day, many of us stress about how to best show our moms just how much we appreciate everything they do. A DIY gift is not only easy on your budget but is loving, personal, and bound to show mom exactly how much her answering every little question about laundry and cooking does mean to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to our moms, no one means more to us. It may feel hard to express the level of gratitude you have for everything she does for you. When it comes to gift-giving to your mom, nothing says I love you more than a gift that says, &#8220;I spent time on this,&#8221; and a DIY gift package will scream exactly that. These DIY gifts are amazing alone, or you can mix some of them, and they can also serve you for any other occasion.

As we transition out of winter and into spring, every Winnipegger knows that with the warm weather comes rain and slush. When it comes to the spring in Winnipeg, the last thing you want to be is unprepared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may feel like you have to compromise on staying fashionable to be able to remain dry in this weather like there is no point in even trying to stay on trend in the rain, snow, and slush. Don&#8217;t give up on your style just yet! There are lots of great ways to stay dry and remain in head-to-toe fashion this spring without compromising on your &#8216;outfit of the day&#8217; likes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"848\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7754\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277.png 848w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jack-redgate-2929277-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Put Your Best Foot Forward</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to navigating the slushy streets of downtown Winnipeg, having footwear that can trudge through the inevitable slush while still looking fresh is a must for your spring wardrobe. A great pair of waterproof boots or shoes will make all the difference when it comes to beating the weather and still looking great going from outside to inside. You want to make sure that you choose shoes that are made waterproof to avoid damaging a great pair that isn&#8217;t made to withstand the spring conditions. Most pairs of waterproof shoes are made to resist the snow and slush without damaging the fabric, even without a shoe protector, but you still don&#8217;t want to skip out on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"902\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7755\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png 902w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-900x602.png 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shoe Protector</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what pair of shoes fits your personal style, make sure you keep them protected from the conditions too. Even though most pairs of waterproof shoes can be worn without a protective spray, no problem, when it comes to the fact that you are going through slush and rain, you do want to do what you can to help keep them in the best condition for as long as possible. Using a protecting spray and cleanser that is made for your shoe material will help them resist wear and tear and prevent the fabric from salt and water damage, keeping them looking fresh year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mukluks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mukluks are a popular choice in Winnipeg for very good reason. Not only are the traditional Moccasin made perfect for any of Manitoba&#8217;s conditions, but they also look great and keep you dry and warm in any season. They are great because the rubber sole and waterproof fabrics are made to get you through the worst that mother nature throws at us. I know that I can trust mine to get me from point A to B in the ice and snow or rain and slush without damaging my shoes or my outfit. When it comes to the fur and material of the Mukluks, they are made waterproof to withstand the rain and snow, but you still want to use a protector on these, particularly to keep the fabric and fur in their best condition year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blundstones</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want something a little more versatile that is great right through from spring to fall, Blundstones and similarly styled shoes are a great option for not only the water and slush, but they are light enough to keep wearing throughout the summer, and it&#8217;s a bonus that they look great with almost anything. These are fashionable leather ankle boots that are not only trending but versatile. These are a great style when you have to wear them inside and out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7756\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519.png 1530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rubber Boots</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubber boots are a cute classic option when you can&#8217;t get out of staying in and safe from the rain. Make it dry from door to door dry through puddles and slush. You can&#8217;t go wrong with a pair of rubber boots in your rainy-day wardrobe. With thousands of cute cuts, styles, and accessories to go with them, you are going to end up wanting to wear your rubber boots this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rubber Boot Liners</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to compromise style for functionality on days when you have to wear your rubber boots. Rubber boot liners are a fashionable addition that goes with any style. Most brands and companies like Hunter have helped make wearing rubber boots from drab to fab. Not only do they add an extra soft liner for your boot, so you don&#8217;t have to walk on rubber, but they look great too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Woman wearing hat and jacket\" class=\"wp-image-7758\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cute Classic Coats</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every spring wardrobe needs a classic coat to complete it.

Their waterproof fabric, longer cut, and tie-up waist are a great way to keep your whole outfit dry and heads turning your way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7763\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-yaroslav-shuraev-8499450-1.png 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Classic Rain Coats</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t avoid the rain, embrace it! Raincoats are an adorable and practical way to get through the rain and keep your outfit dry without absorbing water itself. You definitely want to keep one in your closet, along with some of these next accessories for a rainy day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hats</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another staple of the rainy day wardrobe is, of course, hats! Rain and bucket hats have been making a huge splash with their stylish comeback. Not only are they the missing piece to your rainy-day wardrobe, but they are also one of the staples for staying on trend this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7764\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-nataliya-vaitkevich-4813825-2.png 1231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accessories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to beating the rain and slush this spring, accessories are key! Winnipeg is known for its unpredictable weather, especially in the spring. We literally have to be prepared to go from snow to rain, and back again all within the same week. Having the right accessories on you could make all the difference in how you, and your clothes, handle the ever-changing spring season.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-castorly-stock-3836252.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7765\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-castorly-stock-3836252.png 750w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-castorly-stock-3836252-300x190.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-castorly-stock-3836252-293x186.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-castorly-stock-3836252-500x317.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Umbrella</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The umbrella is something we all think is overrated until it comes time actually to need one. It goes without saying that everyone should have an umbrella on standby in their closet or bag, just in case of unexpected rainfall or drive-by splashes. Anyone who has waited at a bus stop knows exactly what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pocket Poncho</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Be prepared for unexpected rainfall with a pocket poncho. These are great to keep in your bag or your car just in case you are caught in the rain, without a jacket or umbrella. They have come a long way from the plastic bag look they used to come in. You can find many fashionable options that you will actually want to wear that you&#8217;ll be glad you have on you when you do have to wear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is one of the most fashionable times of the year, but it can be hard to stay that way when it is almost one of the messiest times of the year. But with these great pieces in your wardrobe, you will be ready for anything without having to compromise on style. It&#8217;s easy to make the most of the beautiful spring season while navigating through the slushy streets of Winnipeg when your outfit of the day can keep up with our ever-changing conditions as the weather is getting warmer.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is safe to say the spring season is finally here to stay, and after a long winter, Winnipeg is welcoming it warmly!

There are a few different ways you can use the seeds; no matter which way you choose, you&#8217;ll get results with little effort and no waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Germinate</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One way of starting your seeds is by letting them germinate. This is an easy process but can make all the difference in how your seeds start and plants take later on. This simply gives the seed a head start to grow some roots before putting it in the dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To germinate, all you need is a paper towel, zipper bags, and some water. Simply cut some paper towels into small strips that will fit inside your bag. Moisten the paper towel, put one seed on one piece, and you can probably fold it over into a square. Place the paper towel with the seed into the bag and seal it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7616\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-▃-1105019.jpg 1755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can poke a couple of small air holes, but you will get results without. Make sure you keep checking the paper towel daily to ensure it hasn&#8217;t gone dry; you want to keep the paper towel wet. Within a few days to a week (longer depending on what seed you are planting), roots will appear out of the middle of the seed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now plant this germinated seed in dirt and let the plant grow. It is a good idea to germinate because it makes it easier for the seed to get nutrients and moisture from the dirt once it is planted, since the roots are already exposed, rather than waiting for the seed to open planted in dirt.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plant Seeds Directly</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to or are unable to germinate your seeds, you can plant them directly into the dirt and skip the germination process. You don&#8217;t have to germinate every seed; most of the seeds you will be planting from your kitchen can be planted directly into the dirt and can do just as well as if you had germinated them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is prepare the container where you will be planting or starting the seeds ready with dirt and fertilizer. Place the seeds either into a separate container, or if you are planting more than one together, make sure you space them out to give their roots room to grow. Once the seeds are placed on top of the dirt, you can either cover them with some more dirt or lightly press them into the dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7621\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-9707239.jpg 1623w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to make sure that you are careful to keep the seeds wet while they are just starting this way as well, especially if you are skipping the germination process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that until you start to see the growth, you want to keep either your germinated seeds or starters wet to help the root grow through the seed shell. You can do this with a spray bottle of water and spray the paper towel squares and the dirt when they start to dry out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Regrowing Herbs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great thing that you can use to regrow is the stems from your fresh herbs! Many herbs that we grow and only use the leaf of, such as mint, sage, basil, and many more, can regrow roots from where the leaves and stamps are picked off of.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7617\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-cottonbro-4503273.jpg 1774w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is cut off the leaves/ stems at the bottom of one stem or piece and place it in water. Anywhere from one to three weeks, you will start to see roots coming from where the leaves were plucked, and stems were cut off. Once the roots are long and strong enough, you can plant them and enjoy the new addition to your indoor garden!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Home Made Fertilizer &amp; Compost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the rest of the scraps from your kitchen to make your fertilizers and compost to help your plants thrive and save on eliminating food waste. Things like eggshells, used coffee grounds, vegetables, fruit peels, and much more can be used to help the rest of your indoor garden thrive!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Home Made Fertilizer<br>DIY Compost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I noticed worked best with my indoor garden was using the scraps of my food as compost for later planting purposes. All you have to do is take a bag of soil that reseals (or a container) and continue to throw scraps from your fruits and veggies in with the dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down the road, when you are ready to plant more or transplant what you have started, you will have beautiful soft nutrient-loaded soil that your plants will love.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7618\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-teona-swift-6913407.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Egg Shells and Coffee Grounds</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest fertilizers to make is from eggshells and coffee grounds. Simply mix your used coffee grounds and eggshells (instead of throwing them in the garbage anyway) and use this as a fertilizer for your indoor garden. This is a great combination because it helps give them calcium and nitrogen, two things that are essential to giving any plant a healthy boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Banana Tea, Anyone?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common kitchen scrap that is loaded with nutrients for your garden is banana peels! You can use banana peels as a fertilizer in a few ways. If you have a compost bag going, you can add it to that, or you can make your fertilizer to give your garden a direct boost of potassium, which goes great with the nitrogen and calcium they had from the rest of your breakfast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a variety of ways out there to make this fertilizer, commonly called banana tea. The easiest way to do this is by making it in a jar. Collect about 3-5 banana peels, depending on the size of your jar; fill the jar with water, seal, and wait. After a few days to about a week, you can remove the banana peels and use the water to water your plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest struggles with indoor gardens usually is the lack of natural lighting available. Light is an essential part of your indoor garden&#8217;s success, so if you can, try to keep them near the window or choose low-light plants to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7619\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-sasha-kim-9413741.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing you can do for your plants, especially when they are just starting, is to get them a &#8220;grow bulb.&#8221; You can get these almost anywhere, dollar stores, hardware stores, and of course, nurseries. This is a bulb or set of bulbs that you put in a designated lamp or light fixture that gives off the proper waves that most plants need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pay Attention To Your Gardens Needs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to our plants, overfeeding and watering our plants is one of the easiest mistakes to make. It can feel like we are doing something wrong when our plants don&#8217;t need any fertilizer or water, but when it comes to caring for your garden, less is more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pay attention to the soil of your garden and the leaves of your plants, you will come to learn when you need to feed and water them. If the top layer of soil is still moist for most plants, you don&#8217;t need to water it yet; wait until it has dried out a little. Make sure not to overwater your plants, especially sensitive ones such as succulents and cacti.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7620\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-gary-barnes-6231875.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is just as easy to over-fertilize as it is to overfeed. Pay attention to the leaves and stems of your plants; they will tell you if they have had too much or not enough. When it comes to fertilizer when we are recycling our scraps, it is easy for us to overdo it, and you want to be careful that you are paying attention to how much you are feeding them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overfeeding can cause discoloration and other issues to appear on your plants&#8217; leaves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your indoor garden will now not only be as easy as ever, but your plants will grow and thrive more than you dreamed they could if you start to include these great tips in your home gardening routine.

And as you clean up each sphere, you will feel you can breathe a little easier, feel just that bit less anxious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest place to start is your physical space. It’s tangible, and you will feel the difference almost immediately. A cluttered environment means cluttered thoughts, so the best way to clear up your mind is to clear up your living space. Start with one part of the apartment; your closet would be the best place to start because we all seem to love hoarding clothes, and they might be the easiest items to give away.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spr7-1024x678.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7583\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-1024x678.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-300x199.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-770x510.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-293x194.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7-500x331.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr7.png 1294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When cleaning your closet, make a general rule in your head. If you haven’t used an item for the last two years, chances are you are not going to be using it again. And plenty of people out there would really appreciate the donation. Tick that ‘do a good deed today’ check box in your head and start packing that box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;When that’s done, move to another part and so on. That way, you won’t feel too overwhelmed and feel like you are throwing half your belongings away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do away with old pieces of furniture you are no longer using and give yourself the chance to just take in your surroundings. To be honest, minimalism is so underrated. The fewer things you own, the less clutter there is, the less you have to clean up, and the more space and time you can enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sp6-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7584\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend some time in the kitchen. Get rid of any old saucepans, cups, cutlery that you don’t want to keep.&nbsp; If you are looking to become more focused on good health and using products that are good for the environment, a good place to start might be low-quality plastic containers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring cleaning your life also means doing away with anything else in your life that is negatively impacting you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be toxic relationships, a work environment that impacts your mental health, or taking on more than you can handle. Sometimes we end up biting more than we can chew only because we could not say ‘no’ when we should have. Make use of this time and exercise to step back and reassess what you are comfortable within your current schedule. Make a plan on how to best remove tasks you no longer have the time or energy for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be able to feel your best and do your best, you need to make sure your own cup is full. Because remember, you can’t pour out of an empty cup. So make time every day to do something that keeps you going, something that you like doing, just for yourself. It could be a long shower, curling up with a good book, painting or simply sitting with a cup of tea without a list of things to do going on in your mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring clean your biggest asset, your body! Take a good look at your diet. Do you drink enough water? Are you eating a balanced diet? Are there any small steps that you can take to improve your diet and your physical health?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spr4-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7587\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1536x1025.png 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-1400x934.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4-500x334.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr4.png 1590w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A good diet goes hand in hand with some form of exercise. If you are not into doing any intense workouts, try basic yoga to improve your energy levels as well as your mood. Start with just ten minutes a day. You will begin to notice the difference in a few days. Consistency is key. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meditation also works wonders to ease the mind and help with developing awareness. It can improve the quality of your sleep and make you feel more in control of your thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, you are your biggest cheerleader. So take some time to write positive notes for yourself and leave them around your apartment; on the bathroom mirror so there is a pick me up note right before you start your day, something on the fridge for you to glance at as your struggle to race through breakfast and something next to your bed, so you can end the day knowing tomorrow can and will be better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spr5-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7586\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/spr5.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Any spring cleaning will be incomplete without a thorough cleaning of your social media accounts. Take some time to out to unfollow people and accounts that end up promoting mindless consumerism and make you feel negative. You don’t need to mindlessly browse through all your stories to find out what is going on in other people’s lives. Because that time can be better spent investing in your own life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Don’t be scared to unfriend people you no longer want to be in touch with.&nbsp; And maybe, just maybe, think about clicking that ‘Deactivate’ button that is glaring at you from your phone screen. Maybe your mind, body and soul need to deactivate from the façade on social media so you can feel the reality of the cool evening air and the warmth of the coffee mug as it rests in your palms. Try it. You might find it more addictive than the Metaverse.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making changes to our daily schedules and changing old habits can be hard and overwhelming, which is why using a specific time of the year, as the start of the New Year or the start of Spring, make it a little bit easier to attempt to make small changes to our lifestyles.

Not all places have the luxury of walk-in closets, so any closet space is precious. This spring, you will want to take advantage of the countless ways to get your closet organized this Spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to get your closet organized is by changing how you store the clothes in your closet. There are a ton of things out there to help you get every bit of space you can from your closet. Try using over-the-door shoe racks or t-shirt holders, scarf organizers, hanging organizers for accessories things like that; it is a great way to get some extra space and keep it clean. Other useful things like clear bins, foldable fabric boxes, and vacuum bags are great for keeping seasonal or rarely used items away and storing them a breeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try these to help your get your closets organized this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over the door shirt organizer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closet door racks are great for extra shirts, scarves, shoes, or anything you have some extra out of the drawers and off the floor by hanging them on the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hangar stacker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty hangars take up a lot more space than we maybe think. If this is one of your usual closet catastrophes, try using a hangar stacker to keep them all together without having to untangle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scarf Hangars</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best fashion accessories is one of the worst things to store. Scarves are deceptively bulky, and it may seem like there is no good way of storing them. Scarf hangers are a great way to organize your scarf collection and give you a lot of your space back too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fabric Boxes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foldable fabric boxes are almost essential when it comes to organizing your closet. These boxes are great for keeping things together and out of the way in versatile fabric boxes, especially if closet and dresser space is at a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7574\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Living Room</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The living room is a great place to get organized in your Spring cleaning this season. It may seem like we have more useless cords, remotes, and who knows what else more than ever, but with these organizational hacks, people will be wondering if your living room has even been lived in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arm Rest Caddy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The armrest caddy is one of the most useful things you can get for your living room. Keep your remotes and anything else you might need to organized, hidden, but close by with an over-the-arm rest controller caddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cord organization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cords may be an essential way of life, but they are bulky and an eyesore though it is possible to keep them out of sight and out of mind. Keep your cords clean and hidden with cord boxes and organization techniques like covers that stick to and match your wall charging stations; there are countless ways to fix your cord catastrophe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storage table</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel impossible to keep a clean living room table; after all, it is one of the most used surfaces in the house. That&#8217;s why the coffee table is the perfect place to get some extra storage. Consider getting a coffee table that either has 2 tiers or storage underneath for you to keep all the extras.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7575\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883.jpg 1379w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Kitchen</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel near impossible to keep an organized kitchen. Our cupboards get full of so many open boxes and bags of miscellaneous spices and ingredients, but with these clutter cutters, even you are going to be impressed with your kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Containers Are Key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to keep an organized mess in your kitchen is by utilizing things like clear containers and jars. Open bags and packages use up a lot of our precious counter and cupboard space. Help maximize it as much as possible by putting all those open half-used bags of spices, flours, and everything else into containers. You&#8217;ll know where everything is, and it will be fresh when you go to use it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Magnet Magic</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magnetic strips are an amazing way to kick up your kitchen organization game. Instead of having knives and other utensils on the counter or taking up all of your drawer space, try adding a magnetic strip for a stylish way to keep your knives organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wall mounts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your brooms, mops, and other cleaning supplies organized by installing wall mounts for them. Many of us have to keep our brooms, mops, and other cleaning supplies in a closet or shoved in a corner. Wall is mounting these things instead to keep them handy, out of the way, and off the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7576\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bathroom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bathroom is a key place to get organized this spring. It is probably the room in the house that is used and cleaned the most and yet is somehow always still the messiest from all of the odds and ends that take up all of our counter and shower space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many great ways to organize your bathroom. Try any of the favorite bathroom storage hacks below this spring. Never underestimate organizing your cosmetics and toiletries with on-the-counter holders, drawer boxes, and so many more ways to save the most space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Toiletry Dispensers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give bottles the boot with all mounted toiletry dispensers. These dispensers just stick on the wall fill up with your favorite shampoo, conditioner, body wash. These help keep the bottles out of the way and give you that much more space in your shower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shower caddy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you struggle with the shelving storage of pretty much every shower, then you are just like the rest of us. Nothing a shower caddy can&#8217;t fix! Add some extra shelf space in your shower by hanging a shower caddy over your shower head for added storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over the toilet rack</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t go wrong with an over toilet rack for your towels and toiletries, especially if your bathroom is already short on space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7577\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387.jpg 1762w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bedroom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bedroom is full of hidden ways to get and stay organized this spring. Try any of these great ways of organizing your bedroom this spring-cleaning season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Under the bed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the bed storage is one of the best ways to organize your bedroom. Under your bed is the perfect place to keep bins and vacuum-sealed bags of your seasonal stuff, blankets, the stuff that has been taking up precious closet cargo. Try to get a bed frame that has extra storage below and around it to make the most of your bedroom furniture. If you don&#8217;t have a bed with built-in storage, you can keep your extra blankets, seasonal clothes, and everything else under the bed. Storage hacks like clear bins and vacuum bags will go a long way when it comes to keeping things under the bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Displays</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to cut back closet clutter is by changing how you are keeping your hat and shoe collections. These are things that somehow seem to take up the most space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save space (and show off a little) by hanging your hat and shoe collections on the wall. Hanging your hats gives you much more of your closet space back, and it also looks great. I have this done in my apartment, and guests love this idea. If you have a lot of hats, you can save space by putting them on the wall with sticky hooks or push pins and arranging them on the wall for a hat display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your shoes, get some floating shelves or cubes and have your lovely shoe collection safe while keeping it out of your closets and off of the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cut Corners With Corner Shelves</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bedrooms don&#8217;t always have a lot of floor (or wall) space these days. You can save a lot of space and up your aesthetics with corner shelves!

Make up for the lack of drawers and shelves by making your own. Attachable drawer trays are a great way to give yourself some surface space and add some drawer space. Add a couple of shelves above or beside your desk to give yourself ample storage around your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Less Is More</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to your desk, the less is more approach goes a long way. The fewer unnecessary and personal items you keep on your desk, the more space and fewer distractions. Try cutting back on your workspace clutter by clearing extra trinkets and prioritizing what you <em>do </em>use when your working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is useful for the other rooms and surfaces in your home too. Go around to the other rooms and surfaces in your house and, check places like desks, tables, dressers, and see what other clutter you might be able to do without or re-organize. Try any or all of these organization hacks in your spring cleaning this season and enjoy your newly clean and organized home!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It’s Spring, and that means one thing&#8230; It&#8217;s Spring-cleaning time!
