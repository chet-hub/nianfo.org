If you prefer to leave it up to the chef and have your meal while you&#8217;re at True North, there is a stunning interior lounge and large patio section for you to enjoy your meal and even a pint at one of their attached bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks is already a beloved Winnipeg Spot, a hot spot for activities, shows, tours, and history. With many new exciting additions, even if you&#8217;re already local to The Forks, you&#8217;ll want to plan a trip there for sure. With new one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants, and even a new arcade, this old favourite feels like a new one! Relax outside or get some work done with a local craft beer from one of the great indoor or outdoor bars and lounge areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Get To Know Downtown Winnipeg&#8217;s Art, Culture, and History with a Tour!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is famous for its beautiful historic murals, sculptures, and various other forms of art throughout its streets. Have you ever seen a piece and wondered what the story behind it is? I know I have, and that is what is so great about the tours like the Art walk and Art ride tours.

The Trolly has been a tourist staple of downtown Winnipeg for many years already. With in-depth city tours and bookable ghost tours, they are definitely worth the ride! Prefer an indoor tour? Many of Downtown&#8217;s museums offer free or affordable admission. The WAG does free exhibits and days (selected dates), as well as a discounted rate on the first Wednesday of the month for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. But there are many other museums Downtown you can check out that offer cheap or free admission, such as the Winnipeg Police Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Events</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is full of exciting activities all season long! Enjoy things like yoga and fitness in the park, movies, concerts, and more!

Take a Downtown Patio Crawl</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy a stroll downtown and some of Winnipeg&#8217;s best food and patios on a Downtown patio crawl. One of the best things about being in Downtown Winnipeg is everything is relatively close to each other, including Winnipeg&#8217;s best patio spots!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t be doing a downtown patio crawl without stopping in at Winnipeg&#8217;s already favorite spot, The Forks! With two new bars, one indoor and one outdoor, an extended licensed patio seating area, and not to mention tons of delicious restaurants to pick up some fantastic food at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Roca</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closely connecting the next few stops on Smith Street is La Roca. They are known for their impressive selection of tequila, delicious Mexican cuisine, and good patio right in the heart of downtown Winnipeg!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tavern United Roof-Top</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Downtown Tavern United (<em>aka roof-top-tav</em>) has a nice rooftop patio and bar that gives you an exciting view of Downtown! Located right on between Canada Life Center and True North Square, you&#8217;ll be able to see your next stop (and maybe your apartment) from there!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7099\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-1400x935.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/pexels-elevate-1269043.jpg 1504w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lake Of The Woods Brewery</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located inside True North Square, on the other side of the entrance from Mottola market is Winnipeg&#8217;s own location for Lake of The Woods Brewery!

Professionally I started out freelancing Social Media Services, Marketing, Content Writing, Design, and am in the midst of my freelance hobbies being turned into a full fledge start-up. Personally, I love to explore, learn and create. I enjoy studying and practice with energy &amp; holistic healing methods such as Aromatherapy, Reiki and Hypnotherapy. I spend much of my free time walking our city sites, river walks and downtown sidewalks with my trusty pup, soaking in the unique history, architecture and culture Winnipeg has to offer.","url":"https://livingat300main.ca/author/jbell/"}]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7096"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/users/25"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=7096"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7096/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7101,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7096/revisions/7101"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media/7100"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=7096"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=7096"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=7096"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"related_posts":[{"slug":"we-see-you-winnipeg","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/300-Main-Frame.jpg","date":"2018-10-21T04:08:37","categories":[{"name":"300 Main","link":"/category/300-main/"},{"name":"Adventure","link":"/category/adventure/"},{"name":"Downtown Events","link":"/category/downtown-events/"}],"title":"We see you Winnipeg."},{"slug":"hidden-fashion-boutiques-downtown-and-in-the-exchange","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC01195-2.png","date":"2018-10-28T11:00:54","categories":[{"name":"Fashion","link":"/category/fashion/"},{"name":"Shopping","link":"/category/shopping/"}],"title":"Hidden Fashion Boutiques—Downtown and in the Exchange"},{"slug":"decorating-an-apartment-with-downtown-spirit-and-style","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dane-deaner-272375-unsplash-1370x1713-1.jpg","date":"2018-10-31T20:54:10","categories":[{"name":"Apartment","link":"/category/apartment/"},{"name":"Lifestyle","link":"/category/lifestyle/"}],"title":"Decorating an Apartment with Downtown Spirit and Style"},{"slug":"east-vs-west-exchange","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC01300-1-2-1-1024x683.jpg","date":"2018-11-15T11:00:13","categories":[{"name":"Adventure","link":"/category/adventure/"},{"name":"Art &amp;
