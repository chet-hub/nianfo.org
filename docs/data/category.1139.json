But when it comes to designing our bedrooms, it can be hard to know where to start.

When living in a rental property, it may seem like it isn&#8217;t much you can do if you are limited by not being able to paint or change too much. You can turn any space into the perfect bedroom with a few key tips, no matter your bedroom situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors &amp; Textures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the overall aesthetic design of your bedroom, you want to consider your colors and textures first. If you are planning to paint, make sure you choose your colors carefully and consider the color scheme of one of the next major features in the room, like your bedding or rug.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7932\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to go with<a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Ideas/Popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> colors that complement each other</a> without being overbearing. If you already have a common color throughout the room, you might want to choose one that compliments the things you already have. You want to go with colors that are the more neutral, darker, or lighter tones than the colors you will be working with; this compliments your bright colors without using the same ones and being too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For textures, you want to be mindful that you are adding the right ones, but you want to avoid having too many. Textures include things like your rug, pillows, blankets, and patterns. These are all things that have and create their texture, and you want to make sure you choose the same or complementary and not add too many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7929\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t painting, having white walls in your bedroom is a great way to trick the eye into feeling like the space is bigger than it is. If you have a smaller space, it might be better to go with white to make the space feel larger, whereas, in a small room, the wrong or too many colors can make the space feel cramped.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Having the right Frame in Mind</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to consider is your<a href=\"https://www.structube.com/en_ca/furniture/bedroom?page=1&amp;sort-by=position-asc&amp;category_id%5Bfilter%5D=Beds%2C503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> bed frame</a>. If you will be getting a new bed frame, it is essential to think about the space and what you need when choosing one. One thing you can never have enough of in a bedroom is storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7928\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> So if you are low on available closet space or don&#8217;t have room for dressers, then this could be a great solution for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pick the Best Nightstand</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the right bedside table makes all the difference.

The bedroom is the perfect room to use minimalism.

If you do have to have things like a desk, electronics, and your collectibles in your room, you can still use the less is more approach. Display things like trinkets and collections on floating shelves rather than taking up surface space on your dresser, desk, and side tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Room Dividers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have to have an office space in your bedroom, it is not only a useful design trick that both helps cut the visual clutter but also the mental clutter. <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/risoer-room-divider-white-black-70182191/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A room divider</a> is a helpful trick to help you focus by eliminating other distractions in your room while working on your desk without getting distracted with laundry, tv, and bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom1-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7923\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Room dividers are a great design tool that you can utilize when designing your room.

If you think that sounds nice but easier said than done, don&#8217;t worry.

Give her a unique and timeless gift this Mother’s Day by making her the perfect year-round wreath!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ideas out there for this one, from the more traditional to the out of the flower box ideas. This is a very versatile gift idea. These are great because you can tailor them to her taste and decor, and no one knows your mom’s style better than you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fabric wreaths</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your mom is the fun, creative type, this is a perfect choice. Make a wreath that matches whatever space your mom is proudly going to want to display it. A great option is using handkerchiefs and pocket scarves as they are an easy-to-find, affordable, and one-of-a-kind idea when it comes to making a wreath.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"907\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7788\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg 907w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-300x249.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-770x639.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-293x243.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-500x415.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-72x60.jpg 72w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-108x90.jpg 108w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great DIY gift idea you can customize for your mom that she will love is a flower box bouquet. Show your mom not only how much she means to you but how well you know her with a personalized bouquet. Nothing says Happy Mother’s Day like realizing their baby really does know and love them back (almost) as much as they know and love us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show your mom how much you with a personalized bouquet. These personalized DIY bouquets are a perfect fit for Mother’s Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crystal Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or your mom is into crystals, this is a great idea. Not only is it sentimental to put it into a bouquet, but crystals are also incredibly beautiful and personal when it comes from the right person. If your mom likes crystals, the great idea is to go to a holistic store (or order a set on amazon) and pick out a few of your favorite crystals that you know your Mom would love. This is one of the most affordable yet thoughtful ideas when it comes to the DIY gift department.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"927\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7786\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg 927w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure what a crystal is or what to buy, here are some suggestions that fit the energy of Mother’s Day. It is never a bad idea to grab some dried herbs and fresh flowers to throw in and fill the spaces and really make your bouquet complete. You can go to your local metaphysical store or order them online from many holistic realters (amazon included). The great thing about these bouquets is you can make them specific to your mom&#8217;s life, needs, and personality. If you are not quite sure where to start with the crystals and do not want to ruin the surprise by asking her yourself, here are some fail-safe favorites she will definitely love:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Rose Quartz</li><li>Amethyst</li><li>Citrine</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Turquoise</li><li>Clear Quartz</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Rainbow Fluorite</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edible Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another delicious bouquet idea is an edible bouquet! If you ask any mom, they would probably rather have chocolates than actual flowers. A traditional gift like flowers is a nice thought, but they wilt all too soon.

You can find fun ideas and more in-depth instructions online, but making a candle is as easy as 1-2-3-.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pick out your wax, wick, and smell.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The ingredients of a candle are your wax, the wick, the essential oils, and of course, your jar. You can get these online or at any craft store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Prepare</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is melt the wax, mix, and set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melt your wax either directly or through a double boiler system. Once the wax is melted, mix in your essential oils. Whatever method, wax, and size of candle you choose will determine how much you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Package</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that your wax and essential oils are combined, you want to get ready to fill the jar and set the wick. Slowly pour the melted wax and oil into the jar with the wick and let it set. Within 24-48 hours, you will have a personal, beautiful candle ready for your Mother’s Day gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"917\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7781\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg 917w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mom is bound to love any one of these DIY gifts or any other idea you may come up with. When it comes to Mother’s Day, many of us stress about how to best show our moms just how much we appreciate everything they do. A DIY gift is not only easy on your budget but is loving, personal, and bound to show mom exactly how much her answering every little question about laundry and cooking does mean to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to our moms, no one means more to us. It may feel hard to express the level of gratitude you have for everything she does for you. When it comes to gift-giving to your mom, nothing says I love you more than a gift that says, &#8220;I spent time on this,&#8221; and a DIY gift package will scream exactly that. These DIY gifts are amazing alone, or you can mix some of them, and they can also serve you for any other occasion. No matter what you choose, here is hoping you and your mom have a beautiful Mother’s Day this year!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mother’s Day is May 8th, and it seems like no matter how much we think, plan and prepare for it, it still creeps up on us too soon.

Not all places have the luxury of walk-in closets, so any closet space is precious. This spring, you will want to take advantage of the countless ways to get your closet organized this Spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to get your closet organized is by changing how you store the clothes in your closet. There are a ton of things out there to help you get every bit of space you can from your closet. Try using over-the-door shoe racks or t-shirt holders, scarf organizers, hanging organizers for accessories things like that; it is a great way to get some extra space and keep it clean. Other useful things like clear bins, foldable fabric boxes, and vacuum bags are great for keeping seasonal or rarely used items away and storing them a breeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try these to help your get your closets organized this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over the door shirt organizer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closet door racks are great for extra shirts, scarves, shoes, or anything you have some extra out of the drawers and off the floor by hanging them on the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hangar stacker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty hangars take up a lot more space than we maybe think. If this is one of your usual closet catastrophes, try using a hangar stacker to keep them all together without having to untangle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scarf Hangars</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best fashion accessories is one of the worst things to store. Scarves are deceptively bulky, and it may seem like there is no good way of storing them. Scarf hangers are a great way to organize your scarf collection and give you a lot of your space back too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fabric Boxes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foldable fabric boxes are almost essential when it comes to organizing your closet. These boxes are great for keeping things together and out of the way in versatile fabric boxes, especially if closet and dresser space is at a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7574\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-rachel-claire-4857757.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Living Room</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The living room is a great place to get organized in your Spring cleaning this season. It may seem like we have more useless cords, remotes, and who knows what else more than ever, but with these organizational hacks, people will be wondering if your living room has even been lived in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arm Rest Caddy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The armrest caddy is one of the most useful things you can get for your living room. Keep your remotes and anything else you might need to organized, hidden, but close by with an over-the-arm rest controller caddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cord organization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cords may be an essential way of life, but they are bulky and an eyesore though it is possible to keep them out of sight and out of mind. Keep your cords clean and hidden with cord boxes and organization techniques like covers that stick to and match your wall charging stations; there are countless ways to fix your cord catastrophe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storage table</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel impossible to keep a clean living room table; after all, it is one of the most used surfaces in the house. That&#8217;s why the coffee table is the perfect place to get some extra storage. Consider getting a coffee table that either has 2 tiers or storage underneath for you to keep all the extras.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7575\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-charlotte-may-5824883.jpg 1379w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Kitchen</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel near impossible to keep an organized kitchen. Our cupboards get full of so many open boxes and bags of miscellaneous spices and ingredients, but with these clutter cutters, even you are going to be impressed with your kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Containers Are Key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to keep an organized mess in your kitchen is by utilizing things like clear containers and jars. Open bags and packages use up a lot of our precious counter and cupboard space. Help maximize it as much as possible by putting all those open half-used bags of spices, flours, and everything else into containers. You&#8217;ll know where everything is, and it will be fresh when you go to use it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Magnet Magic</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magnetic strips are an amazing way to kick up your kitchen organization game. Instead of having knives and other utensils on the counter or taking up all of your drawer space, try adding a magnetic strip for a stylish way to keep your knives organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wall mounts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your brooms, mops, and other cleaning supplies organized by installing wall mounts for them. Many of us have to keep our brooms, mops, and other cleaning supplies in a closet or shoved in a corner. Wall is mounting these things instead to keep them handy, out of the way, and off the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7576\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-christa-grover-1910472.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bathroom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bathroom is a key place to get organized this spring. It is probably the room in the house that is used and cleaned the most and yet is somehow always still the messiest from all of the odds and ends that take up all of our counter and shower space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many great ways to organize your bathroom. Try any of the favorite bathroom storage hacks below this spring. Never underestimate organizing your cosmetics and toiletries with on-the-counter holders, drawer boxes, and so many more ways to save the most space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Toiletry Dispensers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give bottles the boot with all mounted toiletry dispensers. These dispensers just stick on the wall fill up with your favorite shampoo, conditioner, body wash. These help keep the bottles out of the way and give you that much more space in your shower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shower caddy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you struggle with the shelving storage of pretty much every shower, then you are just like the rest of us. Nothing a shower caddy can&#8217;t fix! Add some extra shelf space in your shower by hanging a shower caddy over your shower head for added storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over the toilet rack</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t go wrong with an over toilet rack for your towels and toiletries, especially if your bathroom is already short on space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7577\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-vlada-karpovich-4050387.jpg 1762w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bedroom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bedroom is full of hidden ways to get and stay organized this spring. Try any of these great ways of organizing your bedroom this spring-cleaning season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Under the bed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the bed storage is one of the best ways to organize your bedroom. Under your bed is the perfect place to keep bins and vacuum-sealed bags of your seasonal stuff, blankets, the stuff that has been taking up precious closet cargo. Try to get a bed frame that has extra storage below and around it to make the most of your bedroom furniture. If you don&#8217;t have a bed with built-in storage, you can keep your extra blankets, seasonal clothes, and everything else under the bed. Storage hacks like clear bins and vacuum bags will go a long way when it comes to keeping things under the bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Displays</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to cut back closet clutter is by changing how you are keeping your hat and shoe collections. These are things that somehow seem to take up the most space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save space (and show off a little) by hanging your hat and shoe collections on the wall. Hanging your hats gives you much more of your closet space back, and it also looks great. I have this done in my apartment, and guests love this idea. If you have a lot of hats, you can save space by putting them on the wall with sticky hooks or push pins and arranging them on the wall for a hat display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your shoes, get some floating shelves or cubes and have your lovely shoe collection safe while keeping it out of your closets and off of the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cut Corners With Corner Shelves</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bedrooms don&#8217;t always have a lot of floor (or wall) space these days. You can save a lot of space and up your aesthetics with corner shelves! Just a few square shelves in the right spots make a huge impact on your room.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7578\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/pexels-burst-373883.jpg 1677w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Workspace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re working out of a home office or utilize your extra table as your workspace, keeping it organized keeps working effortlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Attachable Desk Drawers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your table or desk doesn&#8217;t have drawers, there are solutions for that. Make up for the lack of drawers and shelves by making your own. Attachable drawer trays are a great way to give yourself some surface space and add some drawer space. Add a couple of shelves above or beside your desk to give yourself ample storage around your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Less Is More</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to your desk, the less is more approach goes a long way. The fewer unnecessary and personal items you keep on your desk, the more space and fewer distractions. Try cutting back on your workspace clutter by clearing extra trinkets and prioritizing what you <em>do </em>use when your working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is useful for the other rooms and surfaces in your home too. Go around to the other rooms and surfaces in your house and, check places like desks, tables, dressers, and see what other clutter you might be able to do without or re-organize. Try any or all of these organization hacks in your spring cleaning this season and enjoy your newly clean and organized home!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It’s Spring, and that means one thing&#8230; It&#8217;s Spring-cleaning time!

Houses covered with snow, the Christmas feeling, and the chilly weather make this season magical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also the coziest of the season. The cold push us back home, and there’s a unique vibe when drinking a warm cup of coffee in the comfort of your winter-decorated home. If you didn’t have time or energy to make your home your winter wonderland and are feeling overwhelmed, I’ve curated a few -easy- tips to make your home décor a little more winter-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7220\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Light, Scent, and set the Mood with Candles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing sets more a cozier mood than candles. Used all year long, your candle’s size, shape, and smell vary depending on your taste. However, the idea is to use it to highlight those winter prime spaces, like fireplaces, mantels, and shelves, to make your apartment or house even cozier. Keep the colors on the light and bright side for a minimalist look. Scents like peppermint, pine, and apple are great options to fill your home with the perfect winter vibe. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7221\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make a wreath</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The front door is the first impression of your home. So why leave it out of the décor plan? The good thing about wreaths is that many options for inexpensive DIYs are available, so there are no excuses not to give them a try. &nbsp;Experiment with different materials like grapevine, Styrofoam, pinecones, or even cardboard. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7222\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Throw a blanket</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! It’s that time of the year where we are so proud of our chunky knit blanket. If you don’t have the chunky one, any type will do it. Throw it on your sofa, stool, or bed. The blanket will add a touch of winter décor to your space with an inexpensive, warming, and elegant result.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7223\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowers, plants, and greenery</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t wait for the Spring to enjoy your pretty flowers. Many flowers and plants survive and even thrive during winter’s cold weather<a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/amazing-houseplants-that-will-survive-the-cold-weather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">. <strong>A few days ago, we posted the best houseplants to survive the winter</strong></a>, but now we invite you to give it a try and decorate your home with flowers, foliage, or plants that will brighten up the cold season. To create a cozier look, choose earthier or white colors for flowers. Another good idea is to create a winter arrangement with bright foliage, branches, and berries.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7224\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Table décor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter, especially the holiday season, is a perfect time to celebrate with family and friends. Whether you are throwing a Christmas party or simply adding beauty to your dining room, there are many ways to style your table. From centerpieces made of greenery, candles, and pinecones to simple ideas like napkin arrangements or DIY paper houses, your table décor is a must to give a stylish feel to your winter wonderland.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7225\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bring the Outdoors in</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun idea to give your house a wintery feeling is to bring outdoor elements inside. Rocks, firewood, pinecones, and leaves can create a cozier environment and add a cabin vibe to your favorite space. Keeping firewood displayed or winter greenery in ceramic vases adds another layer of natural textures to even the most urban of the homes.   </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter is just around the corner, and this is the most beautiful season for many winter-lovers.

Decorating for the holidays in a small space can be tricky, so we’re here to help with a collection of festive ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Christmas Tree Chaos</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Miniature Tree</strong><br />\nIt may be small, but a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/s?bbn=6647219011&amp;rh=n%3A2206275011%2Cn%3A%212206276011%2Cn%3A2224027011%2Cn%3A2224031011%2Cn%3A13848649011%2Cn%3A6647219011%2Cp_n_size_browse-bin%3A6819137011&amp;dc&amp;fst=as%3Aoff&amp;qid=1574642410&amp;rnid=6819135011&amp;ref=lp_6647219011_nr_p_n_size_browse-bin_1\">miniature Christmas tree</a> can still pack a stylish punch. A tiny tree is one of the easiest and most common decorations for small spaces. I decorate my miniature tree with an over-the-top tree topper, festive ornaments, and twinkling fairy lights. I also like to sweeten it up with a few candy canes. Even though it’s tiny, I love how my Christmas tree lights up the room with its larger-than-life presence.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6093\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Half of a Christmas Tree<br />\n</strong>I admit this one requires an open mind. When I first heard about half Christmas trees, I thought whoever came up with the idea was insane. But, after a few sleepless nights up thinking about it (it <em>really</em> bothered me), I realized its brilliance!</p>\n<p>Tuck this slim, festive fellow in a corner for all the fun of a full-size Christmas tree for half the space. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/TANGKULA-Artificial-Christmas-Half-Shape-Decoration/dp/B081MYBNG7/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=half+christmas+tree&amp;qid=1574640178&amp;sr=8-16\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/Home-Heritage-7-Ft-Pre-Lit-Artificial-Half-Christmas-Tree-with-Folding-Stand/PRD1TCPD0VT30L5\">Walmart</a> sell cheap but high-quality half Christmas trees.</p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Tree Doesn’t Need to be Pine<br />\n</strong>When you imagine a Christmas tree, you’re automatically going to picture a lush, green pine tree. But I’m here to advocate for all the other types of plant that can be just as festive!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6090\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-671x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"671\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-671x1024.jpg 671w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-197x300.jpg 197w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-770x1176.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-500x763.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-293x447.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-1400x2137.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917.jpg 2045w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for more greenery or just don’t want to go out and buy a tree, consider giving one of your houseplants a chance to shine this holiday season. I like to decorate the <a href=\"https://www.shelmerdine.com/product/fiddle-leaf-fig-tree/\">fiddle leaf fig tree</a> in my bedroom with bulbs, holly and candy canes. It’s quirky and brings so much character to the room.</p>\n<p><strong>Festive Fairy Light Tree<br />\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Kohree-Changing-Decorative-Stroller-DecorTree/dp/B01HO0RVCI/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=fairy+lights&amp;qid=1574642608&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-7\">Fairy lights</a> have so many uses; you can string them up or get creative! When I was first settling into my downtown apartment and wasn’t sure if I wanted to invest in a tree, I created one myself. Pair your fairy lights with garland and pin them up on your wall in the shape of a pine tree (or a fiddle leaf fig tree!), and you’ve got yourself a DIY Christmas tree. Be creative: you can attach bulbs or even candy canes to it, just like a real tree.</p>\n<p>This trick can also be used as a decoration hack for those who celebrate other holidays. Creating a Star of David with the lights on your wall is just as simple and beautiful!</p>\n<h3>Mantel Makeover</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty lucky; my apartment has a brick fireplace with a beautiful oak mantel. If you have a fireplace, decorating the mantel is an easy way to display small decorations without taking up floor space.</p>\n<p>Since I like to keep the rest of my living room fairly simple for Holiday decorating, I make the mantle my centerpiece. I prefer traditional Christmas colours, so I decorate my mantel with deep greens by pinning a flocked pine wreath above the fireplace and draping garland across the mantle. I then strategically place crimson-red holly within the garland and finish the look by pinning up a few red stockings. The stockings also draw my guests’ eyes down to the burning fire underneath, completing the cozy look I’m going for.</p>\n<p><strong>Utilizing Holiday Cards</strong><br />\nI don’t know about you, but as soon as December 1st hits I’m bombarded with <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/search?q=christmas+card&amp;locationQuery=6183235\">holiday cards</a> from family, friends and co-workers. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but at first I was confused about what to do with all of them. Eventually, inspiration struck and I started selecting a few with the most festive illustrations to display on my mantel behind my garland. Not only do they make cheerful decorations, they also remind me of my loved ones.</p>\n<h3>Deck the Halls—Literally!</h3>\n<p><strong>Mistletoe<br />\n</strong>Mistletoe is a winter classic that doesn’t take up any space at all. All you need is a doorway, such as in a hallway, to let the festive smooches begin!</p>\n<p><strong>Paper Snowflakes</strong><br />\nI love decorating my space with <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-6-Pointed-Paper-Snowflakes/\">paper snowflakes</a>. They make me feel so nostalgic about being a kid and spending all winter snipping them out with safety scissors. As an adult, they’re an inexpensive decoration that brings the romance of snow into your home – without the chill.</p>\n<p>I personally like stringing paper snowflakes up on the ceiling, letting them drape down to bring a touch of magic to an entranceway. Try hanging them by a window where they can catch the every-changing winter light.</p>\n<h3>Create a Holiday Scent</h3>\n<p>So, your place looks festive…but does it smell festive? <a href=\"https://www.charlestonandharlow.com/collections/fall-holiday\">Scented candles</a> are the easiest way to bring a merry aroma to your apartment. Cinnamon, gingerbread, fire and pine are a few of my favourite scented candle fragrances; all these are super easy to find in your favourite candle shop! Coal and Canary even sells a cute <a href=\"https://www.coalandcanary.com/product-page/holiday-collection-box-set\">Holiday Collection Box Set</a>.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5RGZdpBM9-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

What we decide to call <em>lasting</em> and <em>classic</em> depends on our ideas of current and vintage trends. It comes from our backgrounds, preferences, and our feelings.</p>\n<p>I might call my yellow sofa timeless, but it might not be something you want to see in your living room every day for the next twenty years. I know why the tweed Chanel suit is considered beautiful and timeless, but it’s just not for me. When it comes to home décor, the same rules apply; each piece of furniture should suit your vision and your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The point of such a talky introduction was only to get us thinking about and appreciating the things we own. In a fast-paced world full of issues such as climate change, plastic and fast-fashion production, we ought to pay attention to the quality and durability of our clothes and furniture. Building a wardrobe and home centered on timeless pieces will make a positive difference to both your life and the environment. Let’s look at the process of searching for décor that will last.</p>\n<h3>1. Stay away from clichés</h3>\n<p>A home that evokes sighs of admiration with its timeless style wasn&#8217;t decorated in a week. Everything that deserves attention, anything that will last, takes time, love and effort to find. I’m not trying to judge Costco or IKEA. However, I tend to believe in other, more sophisticated and exciting ways of discovering your home essentials.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6038\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, ikea\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Current trends, which tell us to live more organically and embrace slow-fashion and slow-living, affect our ideas about the right way to shop. There are many ways to avoid mass-produced pieces of furniture to find something that will add character to your place that you’ll treasure and enjoy using.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit flea markets and antique stores, like <a href=\"http://antiquesandfunk.com/\">Antiques &amp; Funk</a> or the <a href=\"https://thejohnstonterminal.com/\">Johnston Terminal Antique Mall</a>. Honestly, what compares to the thrill of finding a chair in Louis XIV style, or a set of old chandeliers to make each dinner and party you host sparkle?<a href=\"https://thejohnstonterminal.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6040 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, johnston terminal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-770x433.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-500x281.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-293x165.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></li>\n<li>Try local furniture boutiques. When people hear the word “boutique,” they tend to imagine high-end pieces with high-end prices. But you’d be surprised by the quality you can find at affordable prices My yellow couch, for example, cost just under $600, and the quality and the style are tremendous!</li>\n<li>Frequent local marketplaces that feature artists and makers. These markets, like <a href=\"https://alleywaysmarket.ca/\">Alleyways Market</a> or <a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\">Third + Bird</a>, can be found throughout the year in Winnipeg. Many artists will have examples at their booths that can be pre-ordered or purchased on the spot. I’ve found beautiful wooden side tables, kitchen items made from olive wood, and handmade woven baskets that are great for décor and storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg\" alt=\"third + bird\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg 800w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-300x150.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-770x385.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-500x250.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-585x293.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-293x147.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go treasure hunting at thrift stores and second-hand places. Sure, sometimes you’ll leave empty-handed, but you might also leave with pieces that will suit your style and serve you loyally. Search thrift stores for small details like a magazine stand, books, candelabras or even seasonal decorations. You’ll find unique pieces while doing your part for the environment by reusing, recycling, and restyling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Add culture to your place</h3>\n<p>My great-grandmother was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruska_Roma\">Ruska Roma</a>. Learning this explained a lot about my preferences. Every time I promised myself that I would keep my house minimalistic, and style it simply with bohemian pieces, I would find something a colourful carpet, golden candle holder, or velvet pillow I couldn’t resist.</p>\n<p>Don’t let a fear of being different blind you. Don’t force yourself to follow trends and clichés if you feel no connection to it. I’m not saying to surround yourself with only appropriate cultural pieces. You don’t want your home to be a museum; you want it to be your home that reflects who you are and feels comfortable and warm. Add culture by mixing in art pieces (maybe something you picked up while travelling) with modern furniture for a timeless look.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6045\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, bohemian\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Imagine a room where the main pieces, like the sofa, chairs, and table, are simple, but the room feels full of character. Look closer, and you will notice more than basic furniture. Is that a rug from India? Are there French impressionist paintings? Photographs? Are there handmade vases from Poland? Discover what your culture is about and sprinkle it throughout your home.</p>\n<h3>3. Let the basics be timeless</h3>\n<p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: everyone has their own interpretation of what makes something timeless. However, there are some standard rules for choosing timeless pieces.</p>\n<p>Allow bigger pieces such as sofas, dining tables, kitchen cabinets, and your bed to be timeless. The same rules that apply in fashion apply to interior design: keep your essential wardrobe and basic furniture functional and timeless. Then, add trendy or cultural notes to it seasonally.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6046\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Timeless furniture makes a functional base but doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. Research the epoch you find the most delightful or interesting and be inspired by its designs. Pay attention to descriptions such as “retro”, “mid-century” and “contemporary”; you might even keep an eye out for “Victorian” if you like a bit of pomp. Use these pieces fearlessly as your basics.</p>\n<p>If cultural or trendy decorative details suit your personality, then timeless furniture is your neutral base. The more timeless and essential your main furniture is, the longer it will stay with you. You merely won&#8217;t get tired of its appearance and presence.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>The advice that helped me: start a mood board (physical or just on Pinterest) and do your research. Collect ideas for timeless (but not dull and boring!) interior design pieces. Then, enjoy the slow thrill of the furniture hunt at antique stores, little unknown shops. Search Instagram for artists and handcrafters; you might find unique dish sets, side tables, pillows and baskets. When you’re finished, your home will be more than just a shelter. It will be full of useful, uncommon pieces that have a story behind them; pieces that serve you and express your individuality.

I had spent months creating Pinterest boards and circling items in Ikea catalogs. As soon as I stepped into my new room, my bubbling excitement quickly fizzled into disgust: lime green walls assaulted my eyes.</p>\n<p>I could feel my beautiful aesthetic daydreams being crushed. Unfortunately, my dormitory wouldn’t let me paint the walls, which is standard in a rental. However, I was determined not to let that hideous colour stop me from having the best dorm room in the hall. Here are my cheap and easy tips to save your style when you’re stuck with unpleasant paint!</p>\n<h3>Tapestry is Your New Best Friend</h3>\n<p>As soon as you add a <a href=\"https://society6.com/tapestries/winnipeg\">tapestry</a> (or your DIYed fabric) onto your wall, what lies underneath is your little secret. This is the easiest way to make an unfortunate wall colour disappear. Plus, you won’t lose your security deposit when it’s time to move.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6019\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6019\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/winnipeg-skyline-yyh_tapestry?sku=s6-8105496p42a55v412\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6019\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art, winnipeg skyline, tapestry\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries.jpg 700w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-100x100.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-293x293.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-390x390.jpg 390w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-585x585.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6019\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winnipeg Skyline Wall Tapestry by MarianVoicu on Etsy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Peel-and-Stick Backsplash Tiles or Wallpaper</h3>\n<p>You can pick these up at the dollar store, <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/decor/wallpaper-and-supplies/wallpaper.html?q=*:relevance:categoryPathHierarchy:3%252Fhd-classes%252Fl1-decor%252Fl2-wallpaper%252Fl3-wallpaper:attributeidWallpApplication2016:Self-Adhesive%252FPeel%2Band%2BStick\">Home Depot</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.wallpops.com/nu1650-birch-tree-peel-and-stick-wallpaper\">online</a>, and they’re super easy to apply! You apply them right on top of the paint. When you’re ready to move or just need a change in backdrop, they peel right off.</p>\n<h3>Cover Every Inch in Art</h3>\n<p>I’m a self-professed clutter bug and love having lots of action on my walls. If that sounds like you, this is the perfect solution to your wall-based conflict! Divide your wall into sections and decorate it with collages of artwork, mirrors and larger décor/paintings. Perhaps your style leans more towards weavings, like this <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/677226640/50-shades?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;frs=1\">cool piece from Winnipeg artist Rebecca Riel</a>.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6012\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6012\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6012\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Lena Malevitis from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Use Complementary Colours</h3>\n<p>This ties in with covering the wall in art. It might seem difficult to compliment a colour you hate, but this tip can really add to your décor. For example, to deal with my lime green walls I added muted and neutral tones. I used black and white photographs, a darker green tapestry and a mocha-coloured mirror. Even though I was working with the colour of the wall, it worked with my style and drew more attention to it.</p>\n<p>For help finding colour inspiration, <a href=\"https://www.architecturelab.net/\">www.architecturelab.net</a> is a great resource.</p>\n<h3>Reflect with a Mirror</h3>\n<p>A sculptural <a href=\"https://www.picturesframesandmore.com/mirrors/page-id-166/Decorative/\">mirror</a> is a great, eye-pleasing way to direct attention away from the wall. For starters, mirrors are wonderful for <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/10-ways-to-use-mirrors-to-make-113181\">making rooms appear bigger</a> and illuminating your space. They’re also great for directing attention! Your guests will be more prone to looking at themselves in the mirror than to notice what it’s hiding.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6014\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6014\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6014\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1024x749.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1024x749.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-300x219.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-770x563.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-500x366.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-293x214.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1400x1024.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Erin Profaci from Pexels</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Make Another Wall the Focus</h3>\n<p>I found myself putting a lot of effort into the wall adjacent to the lime green fiasco. That way, when guests came into my room their attention was immediately drawn to the cool photos on the other wall. I also hung lights around the space.</p>\n<h3>Add Greenery</h3>\n<p>Adding a couple <a href=\"https://www.verdeywg.shop/product/ctenanthe-lubbersiana/449?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=false&amp;category_id=2\">tall potted plants</a> beside a wall is one of the easiest ways to direct attention away from the wall behind.

Now that sparks joy!</p>\n<h3>Why Thrift?</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Environmental impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>Every thrifted item means one less new one produced, which is important because the production of each household item is costly to the environment. By choosing to thrift your household items, you’re helping divert used goods from landfills. Value Village alone diverts over 700 million pounds from landfills annually!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5988\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5988\" style=\"width: 580px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://bozemanmagazine.com/articles/2016/04/01/26026_upholstery_in_the_maker_space\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5988\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments, furniture waste, furniture in landfills\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine.jpg 580w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from an article titled Upholstery in the Maker Space, Bozeman Magazine</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><em><strong>Social impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>Thrift stores make it easier to know where your money is going. For instance, one of Winnipeg’s most popular thrift stores, <a href=\"https://www.valuevillage.com/\">Value Village</a>, donates a large portion of their proceeds back into the community.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personal impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>My favorite item in my downtown apartment is a unique, red oak coffee table that I copped from <a href=\"http://canadiangoodwill.ca/\">Goodwill</a> for just $12! Amazed by my deal, I looked online—similar items sold for $150. Need I say more?</p>\n<h3>How to Shop Secondhand Décor</h3>\n<p>Friendly reminder that when you buy used, you’re technically sharing with the previous owners. Check fabric and upholstered pieces carefully before making your purchase. Always check for M.O.P.S: mildew, odors, pests and stains!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shop prepared</strong></em></p>\n<p>Knowing the measurements of the room you want to decorate is key! There’s nothing worse than coming home with your dream rug only to realize it’s way too big for your space. Measure the room beforehand, write the measurements down, and bring a measuring tape with you when you go shopping. These simple precautions will save you so much hassle.</p>\n<p>Focus on key pieces first, rather than browsing everything. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when thrifting. You might be on a mission for a coffee table but end up lost among dozens of decorative mirrors.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Look for potential, not perfection</strong></em></p>\n<p>Thrifted goods likely won’t look perfect when you purchase them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t right for your space.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5990\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Know your style</strong></em></p>\n<p>Combining a variety of decorating styles can be a cool, edgy look, but only when done carefully. Avoid decorating seasickness by carefully considering two questions: What’s your existing style, and what colour scheme are you going for?</p>\n<p>You’re decorating a space that you’ll be spending a lot of time in. Make sure you like the items you bring into your space and that they reflect your personal style. You’re doing no one any good by decorating the space in fads and trends that you really don’t truly like. And having an assortment of colours and furniture can be a pretty, eccentric look, but there should always be an overall colour scheme to keep your room cohesive.</p>\n<h3>What to Buy New</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Mattress</strong></em></p>\n<p>When it comes to mattress shopping, I have two words for you: bed bugs! A mattress is one of the most important things to buy after signing the lease to your new apartment. I think it goes without saying that buying a used mattress is a no-no. Bed bugs are great hitchhikers!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Crib</strong></em></p>\n<p>Having a baby is expensive, but a crib is not something you should want to skimp on. Buying a used crib is risky, because you don’t know what type of internal damage there might be.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pet furniture</strong></em></p>\n<p>You have no way of knowing what previous pets were up to on second-hand pet beds, crates, blankets or toys. To ensure your furry friend has a clean and safe place to sit or sleep, avoid buying pet items second-hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer thrifting or buying new for your apartment?

Even if it’s not your favourite thing, choose furniture carefully to ensure you have a happy, comfortable abode. There is no one style that will suit everyone, so let’s look at some things you should consider before you furnish your digs.</p>\n<h3>The Living Room</h3>\n<p>We’ll start in the living room or family room. You’ve got options when it comes to your furniture upholstery, such as leather, wood or fabric. What will work best for you depends on a few factors.</p>\n<p>Nice furnishings don’t always mix well with children or clawed pets. If you have small children or a feline who loves to scratch, you might want to save yourself some heartache and avoid expensive materials like leather.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5964\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-770x577.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should also consider the temperature you tend to keep your home at. If you like thing on the warm side, be aware that leather can stick to bare skin. There’s nothing fun about the sting that follows peeling your body off leather furniture. On the other hand, leather is durable and comfy to sink into. For the vegans or vegetarians among you, leather is likely out, so you may want to consider <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vimle-sofa-with-chaise-farsta-dark-brown-s79206994/\">artificial leather</a> or a different type of upholstery.</p>\n<p>Wood can be nice for some furnishings, but you don’t want an entire couch made of it. (Imagine trying to take an afternoon nap on that.) Wood can stand up to Fluffy and her talons, though, so you might look for couches and chairs that pair wood frames with fabric coverings if you have a particularly-destructive cat. Wood gives a room a nice look and has great durability. I have cube-shaped, solid-wood end tables that I can stand on. They’re great for when my short frame needs to dust high places. Places like <a href=\"https://www.biglowwoodcraft.com/\">Biglow Woodcraft</a> make beautiful pieces right here in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5961\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"681\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-770x1157.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-500x751.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-1400x2104.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" /></p>\n<p>Cost is another factor when we decide what to buy. Leather and wood tend to be more expensive than fabric, so they might end up out of your price range. When considering cost, think about how long you intend to have that piece of furniture. Some people want to buy something and use it forever, and others like to change up their décor regularly. You may want to spend a bit less if you can’t see yourself liking the same desk or chair for years; you’ll want to replace it eventually.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5966\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>The size of your space also plays a major role in your furniture shopping. You might love the idea of a gigantic sectional so all your friends can come over and watch Jets games, but a sectional won’t work in a tiny apartment. Instead, you might choose something like this <a href=\"https://www.thesefourwalls.ca/sofas-sectionals/axis-sofa\">plush-looking condo sofa</a>. My home is small, so we’ve gotten good at picking up furniture that fits in our space. Some people look at Ikea with disdain, but it’s a great place to find <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/rooms_ideas/small_spaces/index.html\">pieces designed for small spaces</a>. We wanted a futon for our spare bedroom/office, but the room doesn’t have space for a double-sized futon. Ikea came to our rescue with a <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vallentuna-sleeper-module-with-backrests-hillared-light-blue-s49277488/\">chair futon</a> that folds out into a single bed. It’s also super comfy!</p>\n<p>You can look for other furniture that does double duty. We store cooking magazines inside an <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/product/fay-storage-ottoman--alexa-steel-212122.html?cgid=LIVING-SEATING-OTTOMANSBENCHES#sz=12&amp;start=21\">ottoman that opens up to double as storage</a>. Floating shelves look good and provide storage for books and knick-knacks.</p>\n<h3>The Dining Experience</h3>\n<p>Does your dining room table simply act as a repository for your mail and random objects? Or do you fancy yourself a chef and do a lot of entertaining? If you’re more the chef type, choose your table wisely. Will you have enough room for your friends and family to gather around?</p>\n<p>Look for a table that extends if you sometimes need to serve a larger group. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.designmanitoba.com/store/p2052/Nexus_Extendable_table_by_Amisco.html\">extendable tables</a> are not all equal. How easy is it to extend/collapse? Do you have to store the extra leaf somewhere else? We bought a great table from <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/home/\">Urban Barn</a> a few years ago. It extends so we can host a crowd, and one person can set up the extension without help. The extra leaf butterflies and folds down under the table, so we don’t have to store it anywhere else in our already-tight space. It’s a far cry from the tables of old that needed (at least) two people and an engineering degree to add or remove a huge leaf, which took up valuable storage space when not in use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5968\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Pay attention to your <a href=\"https://www.thebrick.com/collections/furniture-dining-room-chairs\">dining chairs</a>, too. Do people often linger at your table? If so, choose chairs that can be comfortable for a few hours. When we bought our table, we had the option of purchasing coordinating benches that would have seated 3 people each. They were beautiful, solid wood benches—and horribly uncomfortable. We found wood-framed chairs with leather upholstery instead, so our guests don’t need to visit the chiropractor after dining with us.</p>\n<p>Chairs also allow you to show off your personal style. You can choose chairs all in the same subdued hue or add a bit of flair and a pop of colour! We had 4 different colour options when we bought our dining chairs and couldn’t decide which we liked better. So we bought 2 of each colour! Our <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\">mismatched chairs</a> add a bit of whimsy to our slate grey table.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px; border: #eee 1px solid;\" src=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Technology Can Help You Decide</h3>\n<p>When looking for furniture, you can download a room design app to help you decide what you want! It’s fun to virtually plan out a room to see what it might look like and what will fit. With the right app, you can do more than use your imagination when you are trying to decide what works and doesn’t. Here’s an article that links to some <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-7-best-apps-for-room-design-amp-room-layout-244213\">popular room design apps you can try</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d still recommend going to showrooms, since look and size are only part of the picture when it comes to choosing furniture. I’m always most concerned with comfort and practicality in my furniture, but you can choose to go entirely online for your furniture buying. Either way, take the time to do your research and think about what you truly need. Buying furniture is far more expensive than buying clothes and you’ll be living with your decisions for a long time. Don’t get stuck with buyer’s remorse when it comes to your furniture!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Where is your favourite place to shop for furniture in Winnipeg?

You want it to change. You’re just not sure what that means or where to begin.</p>\n<p>No, I’m not about to tell you what to do with it. I am by no means an expert; I have found myself in your predicament more than once. Typically, my fix was calling my sister and brother-in-law for guidance. I’ve called them for help for something as simple as a colour choice. (At least, I thought it was simple!)</p>\n<p>I can’t offer up their phone number, but I can tell you that getting an outside opinion is never a bad idea. But who should you call?</p>\n<p>I called on Kelly Porath. Kelly is the force behind <a href=\"https://www.blueroseinteriors.com/\">Blue Rose Interiors</a>, a Winnipeg-based interior design firm. You may know Kelly from her segments on CTV Morning Live with Terri Apostle.

You have come to the conclusion that your office is simply not conducive to getting work done. It never gets direct sunlight and its decor doesn’t help. In fact, you think that it makes the room feel even smaller.</p>\n<p>You want that to change. After all, the idea of having a home office is one of the reasons you chose this apartment in the first place!</p>\n<p>With this scenario in mind, Kelly provided a few pointers to solve your office dilemma.</p>\n<p><strong>Paint</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dark colours absorb light and light ones reflect more light into the space.</li>\n<li>Never pick your paint colours in the store.</li>\n<li>Walk around the space, holding your paint sample.</li>\n<li>Consider painting the entire room a single colour to unify the space, making it feel larger.</li>\n<li>Use a neutral colour as a backdrop, and then use accent pieces to bring in colour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5928\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Mirrors</strong></p>\n<p>Reflective surfaces make a space feel larger. A mirror can make the walls feel as if they have moved out. Having said that, how you position a mirror is very important. Be aware of what the mirror will reflect and don’t install them too high. If hanging a mirror over a sofa, position the mirror so its bottom edge is 6 to 9 inches above the back of the couch. The mirror’s size should be proportional to the size of the room.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5929\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>\n<p>In general, people will not spend time in a dark room. They’ll instinctively move to a well-lit room instead. No surprise here; you’re living that reality now!</p>\n<p>Begin by considering the ambient lighting⁠—the natural light entering the space, as well as any artificial lighting that may already exist. When decorating an office, consider task lighting. Task lighting is the light needed to perform a certain task, such as reading or working on a desktop.</p>\n<p>Finally, make sure to use a combination of table and floor lamps in order to balance the lighting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5930\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Furniture</strong></p>\n<p>The key to a well-styled room is to make sure that your furniture is proportionate to the size of the room. If you kept your favourite furnishings in your most recent move, ask yourself how well they fit your new home. Remember they were purchased to fit a different space. You may need to purchase new pieces that fit your new space.</p>\n<p>And finally, avoid “small item-itis.” Visual clutter makes a space feel smaller. Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>\n<h3>Thank you, Kelly!</h3>\n<p>Kelly provided some great tips to get you back into your hypothetical office. Many of her tips can be applied to any decorating situation!</p>\n<p>While browsing Kelly’s website, I came across this insightful line: “Your environment shapes your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.” That struck a chord with me and has made me appreciate even more the guidance that I have received over the years from my sister and brother-in law. It also really made me appreciate the value that a professional like Kelly brings to the table.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Kelly and the Blue Rose Interiors story, visit blueroseinteriors.com or find Blue Rose Interiors on Facebook.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There’s always that one room⁠—you know the one.

I’m a foodie, but most importantly, a foodie on a budget—so I cook most of my meals at home.</p>\n<h3><em>Why I Love Cooking</em></h3>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve fallen in love with cooking. I walk into my kitchen and the possibilities feel endless! My favourite way to cook is with no plan or recipe. In the kitchen there are no rules, and I love that. In school, work, and even my hobbies I always feel pressure to be creative in a certain way; but cooking is a different kind of creativity, and I can create without limitations!</p>\n<p>And because I love cooking so much, I don’t let my small kitchen prevent me from cooking up a storm. Here are some of my favourite ways to use my space!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5630\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Small kitchen, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments, Kitchen Interiors, Kitchen Clutter, Kitchen utensils\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>1. Stacking</h3>\n<p>Stacking is your best friend with a tiny kitchen. My kitchen is what some might call an organized mess. As soon as you walk into my space, you’re greeted by my microwave underneath my coffee maker, which is tucked up against my slow cooker, which has three cookbooks stacked neatly on top. Small kitchens usually don’t have room for much horizontal space, but what about vertical space? Start by stacking items that you don’t tend to grab as much, and then stack items that you frequently use together. Not only will you save space, but you’ll also know which stack to pull things from when you’re in a time crunch rather than running around trying to find your food processer or a cookbook.</p>\n<h3>2. Clean as You Go</h3>\n<p>Cleaning as you go is a crucial habit for cooking in a small space. You cannot use your space to its fullest potential with pots and food scrapes taking over half of your counter space! This tip is basic, but a total game changer.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1497982703677591&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"573\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3>3. Use ALL Your Space</h3>\n<p>Utilizing all your space is also a key component to enlarging your kitchen. Try placing a cutting board over your stove top or an open drawer. Use your kitchen table as a prep space or place one of your larger cutting boards over your sink to make extra counter space. Get creative. Just because it isn’t a countertop doesn’t mean it can’t function like one!</p>\n<h3>4. Look Up for Utensil Storage</h3>\n<p>Store your utensils up high! I’m very particular about where my utensils go. I recommend that anyone who does a lot of cooking in a small kitchen store their most used utensils, pots, and pans on hooks. If possible, a shallow cubby is a great space to store utensils. I find it very stressful to rifle through drawers in search of my whisk or a medium frying pan. By displaying a few of your most crucial cooking tools, you set yourself up for success!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1510041235805071&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"491\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><em>Kitchen Appliances I Can Vouch For</em></h3>\n<p>Every birthday and holiday, it seems like a new kitchen appliance is at the top of my list! Here are some of my favourite kitchen appliances that are a must for those of us with limited space.</p>\n<p><strong>Mini Food Processor</strong></p>\n<p>A mini food processor is an essential! Not only is this contraption small, but it’s also a great tool for chopping up food quickly. It saves you so much counter space over clunky cutting boards.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow Cooker</strong></p>\n<p>Slow cookers solve all our problems, honestly. They’re a necessity for those who dread coming home and cooking dinner after their 9-to-5. Just pop in your ingredients in the morning, leave it for the day and boom, a hot meal to welcome you home!</p>\n<p><strong>Coffee Maker</strong></p>\n<p>A good ol’ coffee maker is a must for us downtowners—it’s just a way of life! I have both a coffee maker and an espresso maker, but coffee for me is a lifestyle more than a drink. I think a standard coffee maker is a necessity for all kitchens. Nowadays, they’re so compact they don’t take up much room in your kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>Rolling Cart</strong></p>\n<p>While not exactly an appliance, a rolling cart is life-changing! I bought mine from Ikea for $35, but the amount of use I get out of it makes it priceless in my book. I mainly use it to store ingredients and utensils that I need while cooking but don’t have the counter space for. The best part is, once I am done with it I can roll it into a corner and it’s out of my way!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Got any other small kitchen tips and tricks?

Interior design trends tend to parallel fashion. The beautiful difference between modern fashion and the styles of the 20s and 70s (years that <a href=\"https://www.chanel.com/en_CA/\"><em>Chanel</em></a> marked the most in fashion history) is that now we mix different styles that seem to have nothing in common. Being able to adapt old, mix it with new, and add elements that reflect your true self is living fashionably.</p>\n<p>When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing. If someone tries to guess why everything around your house looks so special—let them guess. The secret is as simple as Scandinavian minimalist: mix it all. Here are 5 things you need to know to get started.</p>\n<h3>1. Do your research</h3>\n<p>Perhaps you’re at the threshold, about to refurnish your apartment or just moved into a new place. Either way, the question running through your mind is the same: “How do I make my home nicer, fashionable or just refreshing?”</p>\n<p>At this stage, you might already have an idea of how you want your place to look. But in the worst-case scenario, you can’t even imagine; just picking a color for your new couch sounds about as fun as a polar bear dip. Either way, a little research will get your home makeover off to the right start!</p>\n<p>If you already know what you crave, research will give you fresh ideas and inspiration. It will open up new horizons, help you make decisions, and narrow down your preferences to one or two major styles.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example: we all like different things. Ask my husband and I what we think about mid-century nightstands, and you’ll hear a lot of arguments. Mid-century nightstands are the only thing we couldn’t agree on when furnishing our bedroom. In situations like this, doing a bit of research can uncover new ideas, compromises, and inspiration.</p>\n<p>I suggest <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.ca/\">Pinterest</a> (of course!), interior design books—for a general feel—and movies. Inspiration can come from anywhere! We’re all drawn to certain items and materials that reflect our interests, preferences, and dreams. The key to décor that you love is to listen to that voice inside you that reacts immediately during the research phase.</p>\n<h3>2. Modern design</h3>\n<p>Modern design is hard to define exactly. It reflects modern art and features the best of minimalism, sophistication, and elegance. Modern interior design is also known for its focus on practicality and usefulness. Every piece in a modern apartment should be useful, rather than artsy and architectural.</p>\n<p>Simple lines. Neutral tones. Earthy colors. Open space. That’s the core of modern interior design. This aesthetic has its roots in Scandinavian and German architecture and features more colourful accents than true minimalism does (we’ll get to that later).</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4686\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4686\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4686\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Design, Living Room, Home Decor, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Luxury Apartment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4686\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From tianya1223 on Pixabay</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The open areas, minimalistic and airy aesthetic in modern design has one big disadvantage: It can feel like an office. If you decide to go for a modern look, avoid the strictness and simplicity that is inherent to office space. Focus on details to keep your apartment feeling warm and comfortable. Sentimental photographs of your cat, colourful paintings, wool-textured blankets on the couch, and a few vintage candle holders keep a modern simple space looking cozy and welcoming.</p>\n<h3>3. Vintage interior design</h3>\n<p>Romantic, elegant and as cozy as grandma’s house: that’s vintage interior design. Vintage décor creates a feeling of nostalgia through old-fashioned style furniture and lots of texture in pillows, blankets, vases, and paintings. Details like scratches and scrapes on furniture are essential! I suggest visiting your grandparents and asking for that old, scratched-up dresser to make it a statement piece in your bedroom.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4688\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4688\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4688\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg 237w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-770x975.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-809x1024.jpg 809w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-500x633.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-293x371.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-1400x1773.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4688\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4689\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4689\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4689\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>As cozy as vintage can be, it’s important to achieve balance between old and new. It would be easy to go to a flea market and buy a set of furniture, floral wallpaper, a record player, and call it a day; the danger is that your space might end up looking bulky and copied. It might look and feel like living in an old movie. This is where balance comes in: Use antiques and vintage finds as accents.</p>\n<p>Beside a modern grey couch, place an antique blush pink sofa chair. Instead of floral wallpaper, paint your walls grey or white and hang vintage photographs or oil paintings. Definitely show off your record player and vases, but use them sparingly! No one wants to feel like they live in a museum of a thrift store.</p>\n<h3>4. Minimalist</h3>\n<p>Neutral tones. White. Lots of white. Greenery. Wooden furniture. Wooden details. Nothing extra. Nothing extravagant. Minimalist interior design takes its cues from Scandinavia and had a huge influence on Western countries in the early 90s.</p>\n<p>Minimalism is great for making small spaces look bigger thanks to light tones and minimal furniture. Some might call minimalist design boring, but I call it clean and intellectual. It’s like thinking “clean” and getting rid of things that are not necessary—in your life and in your apartment.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4691\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4691\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Minimalist, Minimalism, Scandinavian Design, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-770x1153.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-500x749.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-293x439.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-1400x2097.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Alexandra Gorn from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Think simple lines, linen textures, and light color palettes when decorating your apartment like a minimalist. To void an empty, clinic-like feeling, add unexpected details. A painting by a young, unknown artist? Great choice! It shows off your personality and passion for art. Wooden side table with a funky architectural shape? Go for it, and make it the highlight of the room.</p>\n<p>Minimalism is all about quality, not quantity, and “less is more” is the rule. Combine sophisticated furniture with clean lines with small, meaningful things—like that quirky painting—to make your place feel special, while still keeping things simple.</p>\n<h3>5. Mixing and matching</h3>\n<p>Mixing-and-matching is its own trend, complete with rules and suggestions for mixing and matching different styles. The first rule that applies in mixing styles is to express yourself boldly, but—there’s always a but—don’t go crazy and overload the space. Choose a theme (like any of the styles above) and stick to that idea to create an overall feel. Then, go and have some fun!</p>\n<p>Mix old wooden chairs with colourful metal chairs around the kitchen table. Get brightly-patterned dishes and mix them with minimalistic white dishes. Hang linen curtains and throw plaid wool blankets on the couch. The possibilities are endless!</p>\n<p>The beauty of mixing and matching is in an artsy composition. First, you create a background; I personally love light grey and white walls. Then, you can start throwing splashes of colours. Select two or three colours that work together, and use them as main accents when getting pillows, paintings and coffee mugs.</p>\n<p>My own place is a mix of vintage and minimalist styles. I have piles of old books scattered around, paintings, black-white photographs, and a yellow 50s-style couch. I use simple wooden, grey, or white furniture as a background that I can add color to. Pillows and blankets are my two favourite accents that I can change depending on the season and my mood. While I stick to neutral colours in general, drops of colours are seen in details like bohemian dishware, my blue office chair, and colourful and light wooden photo frames.</p>\n<p>Furnishing an apartment should feel exciting and fun! You just need some patience to find those special pieces, loving eyes, time, and a will to create an outstanding space around yourself.</p>\n<p><em>So which side are you on—mixing and matching, or sticking to one style throughout?</em></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing.
