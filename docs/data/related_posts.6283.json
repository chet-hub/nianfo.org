As the introvertiest of introverts, spending time at home is something I relish, but if you’re the type who likes to be on the go, you probably feel like you’re grounded and it </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">wasn’t even your fault</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">! Lucky for you, being sent to my room was always my punishment of choice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you’re stuck at home, here is my guide on how to cope in confinement:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 1: Take a deep breath</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The first thing to remember is that you’re at home, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">so </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">relax! Easier said than done, I know. When you have places to go and people to see, you’re usually on a clearly</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8211;</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">defined schedule. Since you’re </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">staying </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">home </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">right </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">now, take a deep breath and slow down: sleep in longer than usual, stay up late watching that critically</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8211;</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">acclaimed movie, prepare that delicious but oh-so-time-consuming recipe. Whatever it is, take your time.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Which brings me to Step 2. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Appreciate the little things</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Reacquaint yourself with how your favourite chair is comfortable in just the right way and luxuriate in the smell of your coffee. Sometimes when we’re surrounded by the same things every day, we </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">can’t help but </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">take them for granted</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Take </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a moment to reflect on life’s little joys and you’ll be happier for it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 3: Create structure</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To keep time from mushing together, it’s crucial to maintain at least some semblance of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">routine. It’s easy to get caught up in the relaxing we talked about, so I recommend you </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">still </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">get out of bed before a certain time in the morning, change your clothes (you can still wear pyjamas, just different pyjamas!), and aim to eat your meals and wind down for the night around the same time each day.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6295\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"How to Cope in Confinement During Social Distancing, covid-19. self isolation, self quarantine, social distancing, staying home, coronavirus, working from home, non-essential worker\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2.jpg 1921w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now for the hard one:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Set goals</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I often make lists of the things I’m looking to accomplish over the next </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">X</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> amount of time. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">My goals can</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be anything from </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">do the laundry</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">”</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">conquer the world</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">”</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (though unless you plan on conquering the world from your living room, maybe save that one for later.) </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keeping a to-do list sounds tedious, but think of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">it as a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">really responsible advent calendar</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">…where </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">you don’t get any chocolate and the days don’t matter</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.
