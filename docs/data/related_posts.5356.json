Maybe you’re drawn in by the menu, the decor, the service, or a beautiful combination of all three. Or maybe it has that certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca/\">Smith Restaurant</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a> is one of those places.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re enjoying a staycation, a family gathering, or looking for a more intimate <em>rendezvous</em> (yes, even for breakfast), Smith Restaurant should be at the top of your list.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>Country chic. Comfortable. Warm and modern. In a nutshell, Smith’s interior is a blend of styles with something to appeal to everyone. And, given that Smith is a popular spot not only for breakfast but dinner and the after-dinner crowd as well, its appeal transcends the morning hours. Let’s call it <em>Canadiana</em> fusion, with wood features, modern lighting, leather and benches covered in <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> point blankets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5361\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5361\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast, Smith Restaurant, Inn at The Forks, The Forks, Meet Me At The Forks, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Living Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg Restaurants, Where To Eat Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside the Smith Restaurant</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>The service</h3>\n<p>Professional and yet personable fits the service to a tee. From the host, who was unfazed when we showed up early for our reservation, to our server Angela, with whom we shared a few good laughs. The service matched the situation and exceeded our expectations.</p>\n<h3>The menu</h3>\n<p>“Not your mama’s eggs” comes to mind when describing the menu. Not that there is anything wrong with her eggs, but Smith’s chefs have succeeded in creating a menu that features local, seasonal, and Canadian products, which really bumps those eggs up to the next level. Sure, you can order the Hotel Breakfast—which consists of some good old-fashioned eggs with a choice of bacon or sausage—or oatmeal (with a Saskatoon berry twist), but there are a few more interesting options.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbGNNzgKD6/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It might be the Scandinavian blood in me, but the Eggs Copenhagen called, and I was not disappointed. Two poached eggs with smoked lox and rösti potato came together nicely. Of course, no breakfast would be complete without a good cup of tea or coffee, and here, too, we pleasantly surprised.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual selection of teas, cappuccino, espresso, and Americano coffees, Smith offers a French press coffee option. We gave the French press a try, and it was exquisite.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to kick off your day with some good food, give Smith a try.
