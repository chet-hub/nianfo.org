But when it comes to designing our bedrooms, it can be hard to know where to start.

When living in a rental property, it may seem like it isn&#8217;t much you can do if you are limited by not being able to paint or change too much. You can turn any space into the perfect bedroom with a few key tips, no matter your bedroom situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors &amp; Textures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the overall aesthetic design of your bedroom, you want to consider your colors and textures first. If you are planning to paint, make sure you choose your colors carefully and consider the color scheme of one of the next major features in the room, like your bedding or rug.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7932\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to go with<a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Ideas/Popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> colors that complement each other</a> without being overbearing. If you already have a common color throughout the room, you might want to choose one that compliments the things you already have. You want to go with colors that are the more neutral, darker, or lighter tones than the colors you will be working with; this compliments your bright colors without using the same ones and being too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For textures, you want to be mindful that you are adding the right ones, but you want to avoid having too many. Textures include things like your rug, pillows, blankets, and patterns. These are all things that have and create their texture, and you want to make sure you choose the same or complementary and not add too many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7929\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t painting, having white walls in your bedroom is a great way to trick the eye into feeling like the space is bigger than it is. If you have a smaller space, it might be better to go with white to make the space feel larger, whereas, in a small room, the wrong or too many colors can make the space feel cramped.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Having the right Frame in Mind</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to consider is your<a href=\"https://www.structube.com/en_ca/furniture/bedroom?page=1&amp;sort-by=position-asc&amp;category_id%5Bfilter%5D=Beds%2C503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> bed frame</a>. If you will be getting a new bed frame, it is essential to think about the space and what you need when choosing one. One thing you can never have enough of in a bedroom is storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7928\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> So if you are low on available closet space or don&#8217;t have room for dressers, then this could be a great solution for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pick the Best Nightstand</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the right bedside table makes all the difference.

The bedroom is the perfect room to use minimalism.

If you do have to have things like a desk, electronics, and your collectibles in your room, you can still use the less is more approach. Display things like trinkets and collections on floating shelves rather than taking up surface space on your dresser, desk, and side tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Room Dividers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have to have an office space in your bedroom, it is not only a useful design trick that both helps cut the visual clutter but also the mental clutter. <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/risoer-room-divider-white-black-70182191/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A room divider</a> is a helpful trick to help you focus by eliminating other distractions in your room while working on your desk without getting distracted with laundry, tv, and bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom1-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7923\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Room dividers are a great design tool that you can utilize when designing your room.

So don’t knock it till you try it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like trying new things and want to improve the quality of your life, make this spring all about experimenting with different ways to make your home smell amazing. And there are quite a few ways so you can pick and choose depending on your taste and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7565\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1.jpg 1241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My personal favorite is the diffuser. So subtle and yet so powerful. And honestly, there is something so calming about looking at all the mist that flows out. I often catch myself just staring at it.  You can choose whatever combination of essential oils you like, or you can swap them around depending on your mood and time of day. Something is calming like peppermint for a meditation or yoga session and maybe some lavender for when you want to curl up on the sofa with a cup of green tea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to try out different scents till you find ‘the one.’ You can also choose to put smaller diffusers around the apartment and in the bathrooms when you’re having guests over. Everyone loves to be greeted with a fresh scent, whether they are entering the main door or the bathroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of aromatherapy are numerous. It can help you relax, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety—all great things in today’s stressful and fast lifestyle. After a tiring day, you would want to come back to your little haven. And let’s be honest, no one likes a stinky haven. And the good news is, there is no one right way to make your home smell good. There are so many options out there that you’re bound to find one that suits your needs and lifestyle. You just have to take the first step to find out what works best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7566\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scented candles are another way to make your living space smell heavenly, especially if you’re the kind of person who likes warm tones. You can try out vanilla if you want to go subtle, cinnamon for a spicier feel, and flowery scents if you really want to feel like spring is in the air or in your living room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candles also really add some personality to a living room. They come in different sizes and styles, so you can choose a minimalistic version that is not too conspicuous or go for something fancy if you really want people to notice the source of the heavenly scent that will be coming from your home this spring!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1344\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7567\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3.jpg 1344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Burning incense can also be an interesting way to freshen up the scent in your home. It can help to reduce anxiety and would go well with a meditation session. The scented smoke would work well for a spiritual purpose, but if you are sensitive to inhaling smoke, then this might not be the best option for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a DIY kind of person and like to keep things basic, just throw in some orange and lemon slices with cinnamon sticks in a pot of water and let it boil. Your kitchen will smell of citrusy and cinnamon goodness in no time! Or better yet, bake a batch of cookies if you really want some authentic vanilla and cinnamon scent in the kitchen and also have something to munch on while you enjoy the yummy smell!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If candles and diffusers are too much for you and you are looking for a more subtle way to improve the way your home smells, then reed diffusers might be your best bet. They look classy, the fragrance isn’t too strong, and there are a lot of options to choose from! Also, if you like being safe, there are no flames or electric plug-ins involved, so you don’t have to worry about switching it off or blowing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-1024x687.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7568\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-770x516.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-500x335.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4.jpg 1299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to really get creative and enjoy a great smelling room is to make your own room spray! How cool is that! It’s definitely on my list for this spring! You can control how strong you want the scent to be, what your favorite blend might be, and just imagine the possibilities! Once you come up with a winning combination, you can make cute little spray bottles and pass them on to family and friends so they, too, can feel like spring really is in the air. Of their own homes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Spring towards a brand-new scent.

I had spent months creating Pinterest boards and circling items in Ikea catalogs. As soon as I stepped into my new room, my bubbling excitement quickly fizzled into disgust: lime green walls assaulted my eyes.</p>\n<p>I could feel my beautiful aesthetic daydreams being crushed. Unfortunately, my dormitory wouldn’t let me paint the walls, which is standard in a rental. However, I was determined not to let that hideous colour stop me from having the best dorm room in the hall. Here are my cheap and easy tips to save your style when you’re stuck with unpleasant paint!</p>\n<h3>Tapestry is Your New Best Friend</h3>\n<p>As soon as you add a <a href=\"https://society6.com/tapestries/winnipeg\">tapestry</a> (or your DIYed fabric) onto your wall, what lies underneath is your little secret. This is the easiest way to make an unfortunate wall colour disappear.

If that sounds like you, this is the perfect solution to your wall-based conflict! Divide your wall into sections and decorate it with collages of artwork, mirrors and larger décor/paintings. Perhaps your style leans more towards weavings, like this <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/677226640/50-shades?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;frs=1\">cool piece from Winnipeg artist Rebecca Riel</a>.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6012\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6012\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6012\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Lena Malevitis from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Use Complementary Colours</h3>\n<p>This ties in with covering the wall in art. It might seem difficult to compliment a colour you hate, but this tip can really add to your décor. For example, to deal with my lime green walls I added muted and neutral tones. I used black and white photographs, a darker green tapestry and a mocha-coloured mirror. Even though I was working with the colour of the wall, it worked with my style and drew more attention to it.</p>\n<p>For help finding colour inspiration, <a href=\"https://www.architecturelab.net/\">www.architecturelab.net</a> is a great resource.</p>\n<h3>Reflect with a Mirror</h3>\n<p>A sculptural <a href=\"https://www.picturesframesandmore.com/mirrors/page-id-166/Decorative/\">mirror</a> is a great, eye-pleasing way to direct attention away from the wall. For starters, mirrors are wonderful for <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/10-ways-to-use-mirrors-to-make-113181\">making rooms appear bigger</a> and illuminating your space. They’re also great for directing attention! Your guests will be more prone to looking at themselves in the mirror than to notice what it’s hiding.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6014\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6014\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6014\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1024x749.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1024x749.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-300x219.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-770x563.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-500x366.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-293x214.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1400x1024.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Erin Profaci from Pexels</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Make Another Wall the Focus</h3>\n<p>I found myself putting a lot of effort into the wall adjacent to the lime green fiasco.

If hanging a mirror over a sofa, position the mirror so its bottom edge is 6 to 9 inches above the back of the couch. The mirror’s size should be proportional to the size of the room.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5929\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>\n<p>In general, people will not spend time in a dark room. They’ll instinctively move to a well-lit room instead. No surprise here; you’re living that reality now!</p>\n<p>Begin by considering the ambient lighting⁠—the natural light entering the space, as well as any artificial lighting that may already exist. When decorating an office, consider task lighting. Task lighting is the light needed to perform a certain task, such as reading or working on a desktop.</p>\n<p>Finally, make sure to use a combination of table and floor lamps in order to balance the lighting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5930\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Furniture</strong></p>\n<p>The key to a well-styled room is to make sure that your furniture is proportionate to the size of the room. If you kept your favourite furnishings in your most recent move, ask yourself how well they fit your new home. Remember they were purchased to fit a different space. You may need to purchase new pieces that fit your new space.</p>\n<p>And finally, avoid “small item-itis.” Visual clutter makes a space feel smaller. Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>\n<h3>Thank you, Kelly!</h3>\n<p>Kelly provided some great tips to get you back into your hypothetical office. Many of her tips can be applied to any decorating situation!</p>\n<p>While browsing Kelly’s website, I came across this insightful line: “Your environment shapes your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.” That struck a chord with me and has made me appreciate even more the guidance that I have received over the years from my sister and brother-in law.

Shake to mix, and then add the Sal Suds and oil. Gently shake the bottle again to combine the ingredients.</p>\n<h3>Homemade Drain Cleaner</h3>\n<p>½ cup baking soda</p>\n<p>¼ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>Sprinkle baking soda down the clogged or smelly drain, then pour in the vinegar. Let the bubbling mixture sit for an hour or so, then pour boiling hot water down the drain to rinse. Depending on how clogged the drain is, you may need to repeat the process. If you clean your drain regularly, you’ll find that one dose will keep things clear.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Now let’s move on to the bathroom!</em></strong></p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5456\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade cleaning products, natural cleaning products, cleaning products winnipeg, winnipeg apartment living, downtown winnipeg living, apartment living\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Tub and Tile Cleaner</h3>\n<p>12 ounces white vinegar</p>\n<p>12 ounces dish soap (I usually use Dawn)</p>\n<p>Heat vinegar in the microwave until hot and then pour into the spray bottle. Add the dish soap, put the lid on, gently shake and you are ready to clean!

Just hear me out!)</em></h3>\n<p>1 can Coca Cola</p>\n<p>1 cup baking soda</p>\n<p>1 cup white distilled vinegar</p>\n<p>Dump the Coca Cola into the toilet and let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then flush. Add the vinegar and the baking soda to the toilet next (without stirring or scrubbing) and wait until the mixture stops bubbling. Scrub any tough stains, otherwise just flush and you’re done! The soda and the vinegar/baking-soda mixture will also help to keep the pipes clear of buildup.</p>\n<p><em><strong>But what about carpets or stinky smells that linger around your house?</strong></em></p>\n<h3>Homemade Air Freshener</h3>\n<p>15 drops pure essential oil (grapefruit and lavender are my favourite!)</p>\n<p>½ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>½ cup water</p>\n<p>Combine ingredients in a spray bottle and shake. Spray liberally around your home to freshen things up!</p>\n<h3>Carpet Cleaner</h3>\n<p>1 cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>2 cups water 2 teaspoons salt 15 drops lavender essential oil or another clear, pure essential oil of choice</p>\n<p>Combine vinegar and water in a large spray bottle. Add in salt and lavender essential oil; close the cap and shake bottle. Spray on carpets where needed and allow carpets to air-dry. Once dry, vacuum the treated areas and enjoy a carpet that looks brand-spanking new!</p>\n<p><em><strong>And finally, the laundry room.</strong></em></p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5460\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade cleaning products, natural cleaning products, cleaning products winnipeg, winnipeg apartment living, downtown winnipeg living, apartment living\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-770x512.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920-1400x931.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/laundry-4017609_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Liquid Laundry Detergent</h3>\n<p>½ cup Borax</p>\n<p>½ cup washing soda (I use Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda Laundry Booster)</p>\n<p>½ cup Dawn dish soap</p>\n<p>4 cups hot water</p>\n<p>Combine the Borax, washing soda, and Dawn soap into a clean, empty gallon plastic jug (use a funnel to get it all in without a mess).
