We get lots of sunshine and there are plenty of things to do. Many people think of great summer adventures outside of our city, as we have wonderful parks and other outdoor spaces. But don’t be fooled. Downtown has its charms and attractions too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you are living in or visiting downtown Winnipeg on a fine summer’s day, where should you start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Forks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the obvious. The Forks is wonderful year-round. There is the fabulous indoor market. The Common now serves libations both indoors and out. You can pull up a Muskoka chair and sit around a fire in the evening, or you can walk along the riverfront. You can watch the boats go by, spy on the ducks and geese and even fish right off the Riverwalk. I’ve seen many a catfish pulled out of the water right by the docks. There are beautiful gardens and the Oodena to walk through. It takes an awful long time to get bored at the Forks, and it doesn’t cost you any money to wander around.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Forks-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6854\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-1024x576.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-770x433.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-293x165.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks.png 1329w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Parks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks isn’t the only pretty outdoor space downtown. Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park is tiny but lovely. You will find it at the corner of Main St. and Assiniboine. There is a small remnant of the fort, comfortable and original seating, and a lightshow every evening. If you bring your furry friend, you can cross Assiniboine and enter downtown’s Bonnycastle Dog Park. It’s nice to know not every part of downtown is a concrete jungle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downtown Winnipeg Farmer’s Market</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for fresh produce? You don’t need to leave downtown. During the warm months, you can trek over to the Downtown Winnipeg Farmer’s Market. Its current home is in True North Square. You will find it open every Thursday from 10am to 2:30pm, with all sorts of fresh produce sold from local farmers. You can also find baked goods, jams, honeys, cheese, crafts and other fun stuff. It’s wonderful being able to shop in the open air.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Yoga-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6855\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-1024x682.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fitness in the Park</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you overindulge in the baked goods at the market, you might consider joining Fitness in the Park for one of their many sessions. They offer free lunch classes every weekday. They use multiple locations, so this is also a nice way to get to know downtown Winnipeg’s green spaces. Currently, Fitness uses the Legislative grounds, Memorial Park, and the Millennium Library grounds for classes. Their main focuses are yoga and Morfit. It’s nice to get a midday break from being cooped up indoors and it’s a great way to keep fit. To learn more about the program, visit the Downtown Winnipeg Biz site. (<a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Exchange District</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the northeastern edge of downtown, The Exchange District beckons for visitors. You can sign up for one of their historic walking tours (<a href=\"http://www.exchangedistrict.org/historic-walking-tours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.exchangedistrict.org/historic-walking-tours/</a> ). Or you could just take yourself around. There are funky shops to visit and eateries aplenty, from poutine to fancy cuisine. Lose yourself on the winding streets and pretend you are visiting a city from a hundred years ago. The heritage buildings are delightful and a photographer’s dream. We are lucky that Winnipeg’s stalled economic progression from last century left us this beautiful legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Garden-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6856\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden.png 1296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gardens</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like flowers and pretty foliage? Who doesn’t? While you can see some lovely examples at the parks already mentioned, there are two other places downtown that are worth a visit. The Manitoba Legislature and surrounding buildings are lovely all year, but summer adds a pretty splash of colour. From the Leg, you can also walk down to the Riverwalk and enjoy the Assiniboine River.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the Leg, it’s a short walk to Dalnavert Museum on Carlton St. You may know it for its indoor tours of life in the 1800s, but the outdoor grounds are also worth a viewing. You can do a self-guided garden tour in the summertime. The gardens surround the house and are divided into six distinctive areas. Visit <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.friendsofdalnavert.ca</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Boat Tours</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you get sick of using your feet, you can head back to where you started, the Forks, for a river tour. Splash Dash is at it again this summer. You can book a ticket on their boats and cruise both the Assiniboine and Red, while learning a dash of history from your driver. Covid has changed their rules a little, but you can still book in with a group for a relaxing tour. Check them out at <a href=\"http://www.splashdash.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.splashdash.ca</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Material Future Summer Events</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we said seven, but let’s add an eighth reason to visit downtown — patios! Yep, downtown Winnipeg is chock full of them. Big ones, small ones, even rooftop ones. If you are looking for inspiration, check out the recent Patio Fest put on by Downtown Winnipeg Biz for location inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Patio-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6857\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1024x682.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio.png 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, while Covid still has many attractions closed, some will return later this summer and others will return next year. The Winnipeg Art Gallery, with its beautiful new Qaumajuq exhibit showcasing Inuit art, will likely be open by summer’s end, as will the Manitoba Museum. Once sporting events are back, it’s always a treat to take in a Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fish have an exceptional baseball park just across from the Forks. I don’t know about you, but I certainly miss stadium popcorn, hot dogs and drinks. Other events, like outdoor movies, might also return, making downtown an even more happening place. And if you live downtown, you don’t even need to worry about parking. That sounds rather ideal to me.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winnipeg in summer can be a glorious place.

I think it’s safe to say it’s not in most of ours. But it happens. Then suddenly, your life is in upheaval and your vision for the future needs to change. It’s stressful and kind of scary. And it sucks. But, it can also be an exciting opportunity to establish the new and improved, independent you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mondo checkbox on that to-do list is finding your new home. It’s a pretty daunting task. For most of us, being at home makes us feel comfortable and safe. If you don’t have that refuge to return to, or it’s full of reminders of your past life, well, it can make a tough time even harder. But it <em>is </em>possible, and even manageable. <em>You’ve got this.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that if I can do it, you can too. It won’t be easy, but you’ll be back on your feet in no time. Remember though, every situation is unique. Assess your circumstances and then tackle those hurdles as only you can!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you do anything else, you’ve got to answer this all important question:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s your budget?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A budget is <em>integral</em> to starting things off right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re going from living with a spouse and splitting the expenses to living on your own, you’re going to need to reassess your finances. Depending on your situation, this may drastically affect your standard of living (harsh, but true).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break down your monthly income and your current expenses. Which are non-negotiable? Which can be reduced? And when in doubt, round up! If you always count on socking away a little extra, the surplus will help to cover any unexpected expenses that crop up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a ballpark figure, about 30% of your monthly income is going toward rent. Depending on your earnings and your housing needs, that number might be even higher. In the quest for your new address, be sure to consider what utilities and amenities are included &#8211; a higher monthly payment might be worth it if it covers your electric bill and gym membership too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve run the numbers and you’re going to be hard pressed to make ends meet, <em>don’t panic</em>. There is social support in place for this situation you may qualify for. Those in Manitoba can find out more through the 2-1-1 phone line or website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know how much you’re prepared to spend, it’s time to hit the bricks (or the search engine).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6801\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-300x203.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-770x521.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-293x198.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-500x338.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1.jpg 1338w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding a place</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like with any important decision: take your time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another way of saying <strong>don’t take the first thing that comes along</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re eager to get out of this limbo and on with your life! But it’s worth it to look around and weigh your options (especially remembering some ‌places I considered &#8211; yikes!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do you want a place that fits your budget, you want something that fits your lifestyle. Somewhere you can reclaim that safe and comfortable environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short term, I recommend renting as opposed to buying for two main reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>&nbsp; &#8211; Right now your future is uncertain. A lease gives you the option to adjust your plans as circumstances evolve. Plus, it’s easier to find something that fits your budget.</li><li><strong>Convenience &#8211; </strong>You have enough to deal with without worrying about replacing appliances or building and yard maintenance! Instead, you can plunk yourself in a central location with easy access to whatever amenities you need.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>My downtown apartment was the perfect haven, with easy access to transit, restaurants, parks and entertainment. It had everything I needed to let me hunker down and put myself back together again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re searching the streets for vacancy signs, try not to worry about landing something&nbsp; before the month closes. If possible, shack up with a friend or even your Mom for a few weeks while you get your house in order (literally and figuratively). This gets you out of your old place into a transitory state. You’ll be more motivated to find a pad of your own <em>and</em> it gets you out of your old place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can check into short-term leases. If you need a place to recoup for a month or two before you sign a long-term lease, these can provide temporary asylum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The local Rental Guide, classifieds, internet searches and prowling the pavement are all great ways to get a beat on lucrative places for rent. Check them out and see what your options are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your new home is where you’re going to begin the next chapter of your life, it’s okay to take a bit of time to figure out something that fits you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ok, so you’ve found a place. Now what?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Out with the old in with the you!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things about divorce? Getting to choose your own aesthetic. Now’s your chance to design your space in a way that reflects <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purge the items that don’t fit anymore &#8211; both emotionally and physically. Throw the wedding pictures in storage, and swap that too big, memory ridden furniture for something that fits your space and your style. Whether you’re trawling department stores or thrift shops, it’s refreshing to pick out some new pieces you love.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Plan for Plants!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>People are happier with plants around. It’s almost like we do better with other living things nearby! (We do, that’s science.) I don’t pretend to understand <em>why </em>exactly having plants makes you feel better, but they reduce stress and improve your mood just by being there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not a plant person, you have options. Have you considered a spider plant? Even I managed not to kill that. Or, check out these out articles to find your fit:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/finding-your-houseplant-match/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Finding your houseplant match</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/which-plants-grow-best-in-your-apartment-making-your-apartment-greener/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Make your apartment greener</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Potentially pets</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6802\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-770x518.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-293x197.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-500x336.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s already you and your furry friend against the world, you’re set. But if not, you may want to take up cat-sitting, because like plants, we’re happier with animals around. You might even look into fostering or adopting a pet of your own!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caring for and having the company of animals can be rewarding and fulfilling. But think carefully before adopting a pet &#8211; it’s a big commitment. If your life is already in turmoil, heaping more responsibility onto your plate may not be the best idea. It adds extra complexity such as ensuring your new abode is pet friendly, and paying additional damage deposits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, having an animal around is super therapeutic because, well, they’re often cuddly and adorable. Plus the previously mentioned scientifically backed benefits of other living things! You’ve got options though &#8211; there are lots of programs in need of good foster homes for animals while they wait for adoption, or you can volunteer your time at the shelters themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, definitely crash your friend’s next trip to the dog park!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Get to know your neighbourhood</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re in a new place with all kinds of new things to discover! It can be a little intimidating, and you may still be mourning the loss of your favorite coffee shop, but getting out and about in your neighbourhood has multiple benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, it’s important that you actually get up and leave your place occasionally, even if you don’t want to. Being outside is <em>another </em>of those scientifically backed well-being things. Plus, how else are you going to find the local restaurant with the best patio?? (Besides on the internet &#8211; you need to go check it out!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting familiar with your new surroundings is a <em>huge</em> step toward quelling that out-of-place feeling. You’ll start recognizing the local baristas and it will ‌become more and more like home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remember: Everything is going to be OK</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6803\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-500x375.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It might take a while, but over time things will begin to feel normal again. In the meantime, it’s okay <em>not </em>to be okay. Lean on your friends and family, talk to a therapist, dispose of that pair of your ex’s underwear you found, preferably in a needlessly spectacular and ruthless fashion. Do what you need to do to get through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divorce is cruddy, but it’s also the start of something new. Things won’t ever be the same, but there are plenty of reasons you don’t want them to be. By taking the time to prepare and find a place that provides what you need, you’ll have a new home base and foundation off which to launch. Having the comfort of a home that embodies <em>you</em> will provide the safety and structure you need to heal and start the next leg of your journey.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, divorce wasn’t exactly in your life plan.

And a quick check at the weather app confirms it is 20 degrees. A warm day means it’s the perfect time to try out some new ice cream flavors. <a href=\"https://www.feteicecreamcoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fête on Assiniboine Avenue</a> is a cute little ice cream shop that boasts of not only great ice cream, but amazing coffee, cakes and waffle crisps (I didn’t know this was a thing, but it is! And this taste delicious with ice cream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus? You can take a stroll in the park next door as you enjoy your favorite flavor of ice cream. Bonnycastle Park also has a little dog park in the vicinity, so it’s a great spot to go to for you and your furry pal to enjoy a sweet treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png\" alt=\"Dog Running in the field\" class=\"wp-image-6739\" width=\"761\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png 655w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-293x165.png 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another favorite ice cream spot is <a href=\"https://chaebanicecream.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chaeban on Osbsorne</a>. They have some amazing flavors with very wholesome ingredients. I kid you not, I could taste real mint leaves in their mint ice cream. Their outdoor sitting area offers the perfect opportunity to enjoy a relaxed evening outdoors just enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown while having a heavenly treat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sough after landmark to enjoy the season is the Forks Market. You can pop inside the market to check out stores that offer unique handmade items or simply roam around the Commons to grab a drink and enjoy the sun. The area also offers a scenic view and a track along the river where you can bike or jog to soak up some sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if you enjoy history there are some great monuments to see. And if you’re more into modern art, they’ve recently set up the ‘Forever Bicycles’ monument along with other art pieces to view. If you have little kids to entertain alongside, they have great play structures and a splash pad to cool off after all the walking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking alongside the Riverwalk at <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Forks </a>can take you to another landmark in downtown, the Legislative Building. With its extensive gardens and fountain, you can not only get a scenic view to enjoy a cup of coffee, but also admire the structure of the Legislative Building itself with the golden boy shining in all his glory. It makes for a lovely backdrop for some great pictures, especially during sunset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg also offers an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visit the Exchange District</a>, very close to the intersection of Portage and Main, one of the most popular intersections in all of Canada. The Exchange District has heritage buildings so if you’re looking for a sneak peek into the city’s past, it’s the perfect twenty blocks for a stroll. You can expect to see restaurants, theatres and the Old Market Square with its quaint backdrop. &nbsp;Each structure has a story to tell, if we only have the time to listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not a history or art buff like me, and prefer instead to be surrounded by nature, maybe listening to some water flowing or birds chirping then I have a great spot for you. But where will you find a spot like that in downtown amidst all the hustle and bustle of Main Street? Not too far I promise. In fact, it’s in our very own downtown.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-14 wp-block-gallery-13 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6741\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6741\" class=\"wp-image-6741\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the idea of sitting on a picnic blanket and sipping some lemonade sounds appealing to you then look no further, and I mean literally! I recently discovered this cute little park called Happyland Park right here in downtown. It has an amazing view of the river, rolling green hills and a great play area for the kids. There are sitting areas made if you aren’t the picnic blanket sort and the open green space is a real treat for the eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also check out <a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/information/discovering-ufg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park on Main Street</a>. It not only has light and sound shows but sometimes, you might be able to spot yoga enthusiasts practicing. Feel free to join in if you’re looking for an opportunity to unwind!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring in Winnipeg is like a finicky hotel guest, looking for a reason to check out. So let’s try to make the most out of this season. Use it to explore downtown, take long walks, eat lots of ice cream and smell that fresh grass every chance you get!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liked the article? <a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/its-ice-cream-time-a-guide-to-downtown-winnipeg-ice-cream-shops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here and check our definitive guide to Ice Cream shops in Downtown!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finally!

Whatever day your Monday actually is, plan for something delicious and relatively easy (think pasta night with salad for lunch). A quick win at the beginning of your week starts you off on the right foot and makes the rest of the week seem easier!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Basic ingredients\" class=\"wp-image-6625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2 &#8211; <strong>Consider what’s in your refrigerator.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If those bell peppers are on their last legs or your milk is about to expire, pick recipes that will use them up!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try writing a master ingredient list for everything you want to make in the coming week. Before you go to the store, go through your fridge, freezer, cupboards, secret food stash in the ceiling and mark off all the things you already have &#8211; Ta-da! Whatever is left is your grocery list!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3 &#8211; <strong>Build your basics.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-stocked pantry is the key to successful home cooking. These are your building blocks for many recipes and are enough on their own to throw together a Plan B meal in a pinch. At minimum, I’m talking about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Salt &amp; pepper&nbsp;</li><li>Olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>Soup stock (chicken or veggie are the most versatile),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Rice&nbsp;</li><li>Pasta&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;vinegar&nbsp; (mine is balsamic but if you’re only going to pick one, white wine vinegar is my recommendation&nbsp; &#8211; it’s mild, gives the acidity you want and gives a little wine-y&nbsp;flavor&nbsp;to your recipes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>And don’t forget a sweetener &#8211; honey, agave or even maple syrup!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other good things to keep around are: garlic, ginger, onions, beans (canned for spontaneous beans or dried if you’re really planning ahead), canned tomatoes and some canned soups. There are so many things you can do with a can of mushroom soup! I’ll share my recipe for mushroom “Alfredo” sauce below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you get an idea of what your go-to recipes take, you’ll know what else you want to keep on hand. You probably want a selection of your&nbsp;cherished&nbsp;condiments and sauces &#8211; ever since I discovered <em>Hoisin</em> sauce, there is never not some in my fridge!&nbsp;And it never hurts to keep an emergency box of KD around,&nbsp;<em>just&nbsp;</em>in case!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"820\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg\" alt=\"Food portioned to be frozen\" class=\"wp-image-6626\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-300x240.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-770x616.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-293x234.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-500x400.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers.jpg 1207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4 &#8211; <strong>Anticipate leftovers.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love leftovers! Not only do I get more of the delicious things I already made, but I also get to skip cooking something else. If I make up a big batch of meatballs, that’s three or four meals worth of protein that I can either eat with leftover rice, throw in with other ingredients, or if I don’t want to eat the same thing all week, freeze for later.&nbsp; Which reminds me of&#8230;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5 &#8211; <strong>Batch cook meals to freeze (so when you don’t want to cook, you don’t have to!).&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re cooking up big meals, why not go the extra kilometer and make some things that are freezer friendly? This can be leftovers (if your recipe freezes well), a batch of freezer burritos (don’t worry, I’ve got a recipe for you) or breakfast muffins (regular muffins, or egg “muffins”, or even donut muffins. I couldn’t choose my&nbsp;favorite, but there are many recipes online).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part &#8211; if you spend a little time creating these freezer meals, you have several options to grab, nuke, and go for those days when you don’t have the time or energy to get in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Man holding plate of tacos\" class=\"wp-image-6627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1400x935.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day.jpg 2022w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>6 &#8211; <strong>Try a Theme Day!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For an easy jumping off point in your meal planning, slot in a Theme Day (the term for this is actually Meal Templates, but that is not as fun as a Theme Day).&nbsp;We always think of Taco Tuesday, but you could do Mexican Monday or Curry Thursday. Your Theme can be whatever you like &#8211; it doesn’t even have to start with the same letter as the day! Pick a couple of categories you like and plan on them once a week. Fun!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of focal point is helpful when you’re meal planning. You’re basically narrowing down the field from&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>the recipes to a specific category of recipes to choose from. If you know that you’re having pasta on Friday you only need to decide whether you’re making that decadent carbonara or a lasagna that could feed you through the weekend (or freezes really well).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7- <strong>Rely on your tried-and-true recipes.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our go-to meals, the ones we keep coming back to again and again. Well, they’re&nbsp;popular&nbsp;for a reason! It’s not necessary to get a roster of brand-new recipes every week. On nights when you’re busy with other things or you just want something easy or familiar, rely on those recipes that you know will not fail you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My current easy, throw-together meal is a cucumber and tomato salad (and yes, you can have this recipe too). It’s super versatile and as simple as chopping up some veg, throwing that into a bowl and eating!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8 &#8211; <strong>Try new things.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the internet, we no longer need to rely on our mothers’ hand-me-down cookbook for recipes (though do keep that close by). It’s easy to search for a recipe for almost anything and find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even websites where you plug in the ingredients you want to use, and it will return a list of options for you! (Reverse lookup for recipes? Yes, please!). Personally, I’m a big fan of All Recipes where people share their own recipes and others can review them. You can see pictures, read about how it turned out, and what you might want to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One sneaky little trick (a&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;of my mother’s) is to regularly patrol the send-you-meal-ingredients-in-a-box service websites. There is often a cache of recipes that rotates with what they’re currently offering. You can snag those tasty recipes and then buy your own ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9Prep-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Chopped vegetables on the board\" class=\"wp-image-6628\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>9 &#8211; <strong>Prep ingredients in advance.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of knowing what you’ll be making is figuring out what ingredients you need ahead of time. This makes it easy to chop up a bunch of vegetables whenever you have a spare 10 minutes, and have them ready to go. If you can’t imagine where you’d get a spare 10 minutes, set aside a dedicated half hour at some point in the week instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all your onions, peppers and garlic are already chopped, you can throw them straight into the pan without worrying about the prep work. Trust me, you’ll thank your past self for your forethought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So&#8230;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meal planning seems like a lot of work. And don’t get me wrong, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;still work. But the amount of time you put into it easily pays itself back and then some when you no longer need to waffle (mmm… waffles) over what you are going to make for breakfast, lunch and dinner each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking is creative &#8211; have fun with it! I like to use versatile recipes that can be catered to my own tastes. Don’t be afraid to experiment &#8211; adjust the seasonings to your preference. If you hate bell peppers but love carrots, swap them out. Not all your experiments will turn out to be amazing, but some of them will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve got a few recipes to get you started. These are my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;versions of these recipes, and I can tell you that&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;love them, but make your own adjustments as you see fit. Have fun!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Mushroom Alfredo\" class=\"wp-image-6629\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo.jpg 1524w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Mushroom “Alfredo” &#8211;&nbsp; 4 servings</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly traditional, but tasty and with less fat than a true Alfredo&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2 teaspoons olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>1 small yellow onion, chopped&nbsp;</li><li>2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped (this is being conservative, but you measure garlic with your heart)&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)&nbsp;</li><li>1 can of condensed mushroom soup&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup (about 1 soup can full) half &amp; half cream&nbsp;</li><li>½ cup grated parmesan cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Fettuccine noodles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Parsley&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Directions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet.

Here are three reasons why I think it’s important and healthy for young people to move out of their parents’ home and start living on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 1:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Show your family—and yourself—that you’re ready to be more mature&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-chores-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6542\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re moving out for freedom, room to grow, or just a more convenient location, living on your own requires some life skills and emotional maturity. Living on your own, you learn to rely on yourself to overcome challenges. You’ll learn how&nbsp;to manage finances, space, time, and, most importantly, how to deal with unpleasant situations.&nbsp;These are some of the&nbsp;best teachers out there to teach&nbsp;a young person maturity and independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I moved out for college, the first few days were full of delightful hours of organizing my place and thinking about all the fun I could have living on my own. Then came the realization that it wasn’t all going to be fun, and I had a lot of new things to learn: new lessons&nbsp;that&nbsp;I am grateful for, but&nbsp;were not what I expected.&nbsp;I can’t count how many times I thought about giving it all up and moving back in with my parents.&nbsp;However, times of&nbsp;instability turned&nbsp;me into a&nbsp;more&nbsp;mature person and allowed me&nbsp;to see myself in a new light, which wouldn’t have happened in&nbsp;the comfort of my parents&#8217; house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 2:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Give yourself the freedom you need to grow&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"707\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-freedom-1024x707.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6543\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-300x207.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-770x532.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1536x1061.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-2048x1414.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-293x202.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1400x967.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-500x345.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, we all need more&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;and freedom of choice than we can usually find living with our parents.&nbsp;No matter how loving&nbsp;and understanding your&nbsp;parents are,&nbsp;one day&nbsp;a bedroom starts feeling too tight&nbsp;and you start to crave a bigger, more private space.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;not&nbsp;just&nbsp;about the square footage;&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;about the ability to&nbsp;cook&nbsp;and watch&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;you want,&nbsp;and to invite&nbsp;over&nbsp;whoever&nbsp;you want, whenever you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I had to learn some harsh lessons along the way,&nbsp;living on my own expanded my creative ideas in terms of interior design, and my social skills when it came to hosting my parties. After years of living and studying under my parents’&nbsp;intent&nbsp;gaze, moving out allowed me to live as I wanted without interrupting the plans of others.&nbsp;I had the space I needed to find my self—and to have yogurt for dinner if I wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 3:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Learn responsibility&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6544\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Living on your own teaches responsibility like nothing else!&nbsp;Parents tend to see&nbsp;their children as little kids&nbsp;who require constant protection,&nbsp;no matter what age they already are.

The year of slow search not only helped me to save money&nbsp;by avoiding&nbsp;impulsive purchases, it&nbsp;also showed&nbsp;me&nbsp;how&nbsp;to avoid&nbsp;these&nbsp;hasty decorating disasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"948\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-tips-948x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6523\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-948x1024.jpg 948w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-278x300.jpg 278w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-770x832.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-293x317.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips-500x540.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-tips.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 948px) 100vw, 948px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 1</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Not doing your research</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first year of my independent lifestyle,&nbsp;my furniture consisted of a&nbsp;desk&nbsp;(which doubled as a&nbsp;dining table)&nbsp;and a queen-size bed. The rest of my apartment&nbsp;was light on&nbsp;décor and&nbsp;heavy on&nbsp;notebooks and papers. However,&nbsp;a&nbsp;year of dreaming&nbsp;about decorating&nbsp;as soon as my bank account would&nbsp;allow,&nbsp;made me focus on&nbsp;identifying the&nbsp;colours, shapes and styles&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wanted around&nbsp;me. That research, inspiration boards and constant visits to vintage shops&nbsp;helped me form a clear picture&nbsp;of what pieces I needed. I focused on mid-century inspired furniture, minimal artwork, and a&nbsp;palette of grey, blue and yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;surrounded by millions of choices. Online shopping&nbsp;means we can order&nbsp;a coffee table with two clicks.&nbsp;Or we can drive to the nearest big-box store and pick out a couch on the spot. But even with&nbsp;a plethora of choices,&nbsp;it can be hard to find just the right item to make your space feel complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mistake of not&nbsp;doing your research&nbsp;means you’re not&nbsp;defining&nbsp;your&nbsp;style and&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;colour palette. Without a precise idea&nbsp;of what you’re looking for,&nbsp;shopping trips&nbsp;quickly spiral into&nbsp;confusion and irritation.&nbsp;On the other hand, a clear picture of what you want&nbsp;will make&nbsp;every&nbsp;store visit&nbsp;easier—even if it takes you a while to find what you’re looking for.&nbsp;Instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;making&nbsp;impulsive purchases as soon as you move in,&nbsp;focus on studying the space, picking&nbsp;your&nbsp;favourite colours, planning the amount of furniture, and imagining&nbsp;the final look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6522\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-300x264.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-770x678.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1536x1353.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-293x258.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1400x1233.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-500x441.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research.jpg 1832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick research tips</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use Pinterest to create virtual inspiration boards and save your ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Browse&nbsp;interior design magazines like Vogue Living, ELLE Decoration, House &amp; Garden,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Style at Home&nbsp;(check the library for free copies, but no cutting out photos!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Take your inspiration from cinematography!&nbsp;Pick the era or style you want to reflect in your place and gather ideas from movies&nbsp;set in&nbsp;that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A&nbsp;stroll&nbsp;through the park, evening at the lake,&nbsp;or walk in the snow&nbsp;can not only&nbsp;give you&nbsp;ideas,&nbsp;but&nbsp;also be a great photography inspiration for DIY décor!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 2:&nbsp;Buying everything at once&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband is a wise man: he held&nbsp;my hand&nbsp;to keep it away from my&nbsp;credit card every time I was close to&nbsp;making an&nbsp;impulsive&nbsp;purchase.

A dining table is not a sweater that&nbsp;can&nbsp;be worn twice and then passed&nbsp;on&nbsp;to someone else.&nbsp;The furniture we bring into our homes is usually with us a long time, so we should&nbsp;surround ourselves with&nbsp;things&nbsp;we genuinely enjoy looking at and using day after day.&nbsp;The consumer mentality is also changing. Minimalism and mindful purchasing&nbsp;are&nbsp;more than just trendy; they’re&nbsp;a helpful way to create less clutter and&nbsp;do less harm to the&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve done the hard work of defining your design concept and choosing colours,&nbsp;the&nbsp;next&nbsp;mistake to avoid would be buying it all at once. There is no worse feeling than the regret of the&nbsp;poor&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;you no longer like after just a few months.&nbsp;You walk around that no-longer-beautiful&nbsp;coffee table, blaming yourself&nbsp;for not searching longer because&nbsp;just yesterday&nbsp;you saw&nbsp;the coffee table of your dreams—too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hunt is the most exciting part of interior design!&nbsp;Sorting through&nbsp;local flea markets,&nbsp;exploring furniture stores&nbsp;other than The&nbsp;Brick and Ikea, looking for artisan-made pieces,&nbsp;not stopping until you’ve found the perfect piece… It’s fun and satisfying and will pay off for years to come!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 3: </strong><strong>Choosing</strong><strong>&nbsp;only trendy pieces</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trends surround us for&nbsp;specific reasons. Companies follow fashion trends to sell more. People follow them to stay&nbsp;fashionable&nbsp;and&nbsp;project a certain image.&nbsp;Not every trend&nbsp;is&nbsp;worth following, though. Many trends won’t reflect&nbsp;your&nbsp;personal taste, and&nbsp;some trends don’t last very long.&nbsp;The same way leather leggings&nbsp;won’t always be popular,&nbsp;distinctly uncomfortable furniture trends will fade after a few seasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember&nbsp;the year of the&nbsp;ubiquitous obsession with golden pineapples.&nbsp;Pineapples were everywhere:&nbsp;on pillows, candles, cups, and even on bigger pieces of furniture.&nbsp;Pineapples were all over&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;on every shelf and every t-shirt. However, the trend faded rapidly&nbsp;because&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;real meaning behind it. (Don’t&nbsp;get me wrong: pineapple is delicious!). The&nbsp;poor&nbsp;pineapple&nbsp;is a great example of&nbsp;those trends that&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;becomes monotonous and gets thrown away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"974\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6520\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg 974w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-285x300.jpg 285w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-770x810.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1460x1536.jpg 1460w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-293x308.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1400x1473.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-500x526.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple.jpg 1755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, you’ll find a lot more&nbsp;pleasure in simple lines, quality materials, and classic designs. Trends&nbsp;can be fun to play with when adjusted for your&nbsp;personal style,&nbsp;but they’re better suited to&nbsp;small pieces such as&nbsp;pictures, candles, cups,&nbsp;and pillows. Those pieces are&nbsp;easier&nbsp;to replace when you’re&nbsp;tired of the trend or want to refresh it for another season. When searching&nbsp;for&nbsp;basic, important&nbsp;pieces of furniture, stay closer to minimal design and timeless forms&nbsp;to avoid long-term regret.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake 4: Picking&nbsp;the cheapest pieces&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, a&nbsp;carefully thought-out&nbsp;budget&nbsp;will save you&nbsp;money and allow you to purchase higher-quality pieces. Cheap, mass-produced&nbsp;furniture&nbsp;is like&nbsp;fast-fashion clothing.&nbsp;Cheap garments,&nbsp;and&nbsp;cheap furniture, are not made&nbsp;to last long. Brands&nbsp;hope for your return after the chair&nbsp;breaks in a year or two or&nbsp;the&nbsp;jeans rip after six months.&nbsp;They&nbsp;give up&nbsp;quality&nbsp;in favour of the&nbsp;cheapest-possible materials&nbsp;in mass production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until&nbsp;consumer habits change, cheap furniture and poor-quality clothing will&nbsp;stick around. As soon as we, as consumers, understand that higher-quality wood and fabric require more money, and better-made pieces require more time and effort,&nbsp;we can see the value in buying quality.&nbsp;Quality furniture,&nbsp;made to last,&nbsp;might&nbsp;seem more expensive than mass-produced housewares. But&nbsp;by&nbsp;buying a better-quality piece, you’re&nbsp;investing&nbsp;in the number of years&nbsp;the item will last without needing repair or replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6519\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your&nbsp;couch wears out after a year of sitting on it, you&nbsp;might buy another&nbsp;low-quality one.

Also, consider handmade and vintage furniture!

After 37 days of quarantine, my new daily routines had an important impact on me</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6430\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/kari-shea-qa1wvrlWCio-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve never been a sporty person (except horseback riding), and I’ve always told myself that my exercise was limited to a daily maximum of twenty minutes of stretching because I just didn’t have the time. As soon as the quarantine started, I no longer had that excuse. After spending the first week of quarantine feeling completely overwhelmed and eating too many unhealthy snacks, I browsed YouTube for exercise videos to help me feel healthy and energetic. That’s when I discovered online barre workouts. Since starting barre, I really enjoy spending time early each morning doing barre’s combination of cardio, stretching, and ballet movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve also always wanted to learn about literature and art, but never felt like I had the time due to work, family, and life in general. Fortunately, in the age of the internet, access to free quality courses from major universities—including Harvard!—is unlimited, and that is where I found myself. As soon as I discovered a few classes open to the public, I was showing up for online lectures every day to study Goethe, the Odyssey, world literature, Impressionism, and Renaissance paintings.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6431\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4144923-2.jpg 1840w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps learning about some of the most significant art ever created inspired me to return to painting. When the pressure of devastating news about the virus expanded, and anxiety touched us all, I pulled my brushes and canvas out of the basement. They say to paint flowers when you’re anxious, and that’s what I did. The stress lessened. Painting fruits and flowers brought me back to studying in art school as a child. Those happy times somehow returned with every brush stroke. The first day I pulled out my painting essentials, I drew for hours. It calmed me, giving me hope and inspiring me to create more, whether it was more pictures or writing pieces. While I was occupied with studying, exercising, painting, four weeks of quarantine passed by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time moved as quickly as before the quarantine, but I didn’t waste time complaining. Instead, I got back to the joy that exercising daily, studying literature, and painting bring me, and these activities had a huge impact on my mental and physical health. It’s common sense that your body needs physical activity, and your mind needs learning. But caught between chores and obligations in a busy world, we often forget the impact these basic practices can have. I know I forget quite often!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the quarantine was devasting in many ways, I was able to find a routine of pleasures that restored me. In taking as much time as I wished for exercising, writing, and studying, I found reconciliation with part of myself I had forgotten exists. It was as if with the world falling apart, my little nest of delightful activities was building up. But don’t get me wrong: I can’t wait for the end of this global pandemic and the pain it has brought for so many. I can’t wait for the simple ability to travel or spend an hour in a coffee shop—little things that we used to take for granted. But there was something marvellous in living like a lady from a novel, who spends her days in a garden reading or at her easel painting flowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6433\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/10/victoria-bilsborough-U-ouhtPgHH4-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The unexpected quarantine interrupted a lot of plans and changed the routines of many people.
