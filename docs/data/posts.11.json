Aged Cheddar Gnocchi by @itinerantwhisky on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>283 Bannatyne Avenue</p>\n<p>Housed in <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\">the Exchange District</a>, Peasant Cookery is sometimes skimmed over when asked “Where should we grab a bite to eat at?” but it is definitely worth a gander. The menu has tons of options to try on your subsequent visits, so variety isn’t an issue. Everything is decently priced, with nothing on the menu costing more than $40. Peasant Cookery is a perfect date night spot or a place to get the girls together to enjoy a specialty cocktail. With Peasant Cookery, every bite shows you how much heart and soul go into each meal!</p>\n<p>The service matches the atmosphere: high class. No matter how busy the restaurant, is the servers are always available and will graciously help you map out the best courses for your palate.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"http://peasantcookery.ca/menus/dinner/\">Aged cheddar gnocchi</a> with the Sandman cocktail</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Fast-Food-Restaurant/Mitzis-Chicken-Finger-Restaurant-115673538494068/\">Mitzi’s Chicken Finger Restaurant</a>: $</h3>\n<p>250 St. Mary Avenue</p>\n<p>In the heart of downtown, Mitzi’s chicken finger restaurant offers Chinese and Canadian cuisine—turns out, chicken fingers are delicious with a side of rice. What makes Mitzi’s stand out is that every chicken finger is prepared fresh daily! The service is also is top-notch: the staff are friendly, and treat you like a guest, rather than a customer. It’s a great place to hit up before a Jets game or as a pit-stop on your way home from work.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong>Chicken fingers (obviously!) and a side of fried rice</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.banhmikingwpg.com/\">Banh Mi King</a>: $</h3>\n<p>510 Portage Ave</p>\n<p>Banh Mi King is one of my personal favorite restaurants in downtown Winnipeg. Banh Mi King is conveniently located near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. Everything on their menu is under $20 and offers real bang for your buck. No matter what you choose, you’ll leave satisfied and on the verge of a pleasant food coma. The service is unmatched, you will always be greeted with a warm welcome by whoever is at the cash register. They’re also happy to help you navigate through their extensive menu.</p>\n<p><em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"https://www.skipthedishes.com/banh-mi-king\">Vegetarian Vietnamese sub</a></strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://acrosstheboardcafe.com/\">Across the Board Game Café</a>: $</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3521\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3521\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BsnWJqsFzwX/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3521\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Across The Board Cafe, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3521\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside Across The Board Cafe ? by @katriz on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>211 Bannatyne Ave &amp; Main Street</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a board game fanatic or just looking for a bite to eat with a side of entertainment, this café is a great choice.

Famena&#8217;s is a small restaurant, nestled under a corkscrew parkade that you might just miss if you walk by too fast. What Famena’s lacks in space, they make up for with a rainbow of curries and an assortment of thick, fluffy roti. Everything is seasoned to perfection. If you’re feeling brave, try their deathly hot sauce (not for the faint of heart)!</p>\n<p>Enjoy your meal with some light entertainment—provided by the hilarious banter of the couple/owners behind the counter!

VJ’s Drive-In has had an impeccable reputation in the downtown area for decades. You can buy a cheeseburger, side of fries and a milkshake for under $20, and the service you will receive when you enter through their door is priceless! VJ’s is a cash-only attraction, which quickens their</p>\n<p>usually long lines.

It’s been analysed, discussed and debated for a long time, but it’s never been more relevant than today: Based on a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-rent-vs-buy-reader-response-road-ahead-1.4503852\">Calgary survey</a>, young professionals who can afford to buy a house still prefer to rent. I’ve heard doctors, teachers, and other professionals argue that they find renting more convenient than buying.</p>\n<p>Personally, I rented for more than four years before buying a home, and I think renting is an underrated option. People will always have different opinions, and I find myself somewhere in between. I enjoy home ownership just outside of the city; I also enjoyed renting a 17<sup>th</sup>-floor apartment in downtown Winnipeg. Home ownership isn’t for everyone, and I’m here to show you that renting a home has more advantages than you might think.</p>\n<h3>Renting is more affordable.</h3>\n<p>When you purchase a home, you don&#8217;t just pay for the property itself. You can also look forward to taxes, mortgage interest and other fees. In addition to those basics, there will be other expenses depending on the type of property you buy. We purchased a duplex, and it wasn’t long before the extra costs started to add up: gardens, fencing, driveways and landscaping are expensive!</p>\n<p>Understanding the true cost of homeownership is not as simple as comparing a monthly mortgage payment to a rent payment. Don’t even get me started on condo fees, utilities and insurance. When buying a house, you also need to be sure that you can afford to put down a <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/mortgages/down-payment.html\">minimum of 5% for the down payment</a>. Renters, on the other hand, don’t need to worry about most of these expenses.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3440 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg\" alt=\"bank loan, mortgage insurance, buying a house, renting an apartment, winnipeg apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-500x298.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-300x179.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-768x457.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1370x816.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3>No need to pay for maintenance.</h3>\n<p>Maintenance is such a huge factor that I think it deserves its own category. Here’s a great (and stinky) story about how well maintenances are usually completed by a rental company: When my husband and I came back to Winnipeg from our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, it was almost midnight. We were tired but woke right up when we opened the door to our apartment. It smelled like something had <em>died</em> in there. I ran to throw open the window, and my husband checked the kitchen.</p>\n<p>It turned out that the fridge had stopped working, and the contents of the fridge and freezer (including chicken, fish, and veggies) had been rotting for 2 weeks—yuck. You can imagine the smell! Long story short, we called the property management office, and they immediately replaced our fridge. It didn&#8217;t cost us a penny. Convinced yet? Let’s move on to the next point.</p>\n<h3>Renting = flexibility.</h3>\n<p>Usually, a rental lease is signed for a year, and then you have the option to renew. This way you have way more freedom in planning ahead. However, sometimes even the best-planned life scenario can be ruined by unplanned situations. It could be a sudden job offer in a different city, a family emergency, or you could just decide to move because the world is a beautiful place and you have to see more of it!</p>\n<p>If you rent, you don&#8217;t have to deal with selling a house. Renting offers valuable convenience when it comes to a quick change of plans. It saves you from looking for a buyer, paying a realtor, signing papers, and looking for a new place to buy. Hand over they keys to your landlord when your lease is up, and you’re free to move on.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3444 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Apartments, Renting vs Buying, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Living, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-500x356.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-300x213.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-768x546.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1370x974.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3>Renting involves less emotional and financial stress.</h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever been interested in buying a property, you’ve probably noticed that interest rates are rising. Mortgage interest rates are the highest they’ve been in 5 years, and it looks like they are destined to climb even more.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you cannot afford to put down 20% as a down payment, you are required to purchase mortgage insurance. Just to give a point of reference, we had to pay close to $10,000 in <a href=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/buying/mortgage-loan-insurance-for-consumers\">mortgage insurance</a> on a house purchase in the mid-$300,000 range. Property taxes in most cities have also been increasing. Taxes and interest rates add a substantial cost to home ownership that sometimes makes buying a home financially unfeasible.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, renting isn’t a money drain. You’re paying for the roof above your head and shelter for your family. You can save on monthly expenditures and have more flexibility when it comes to your life plans. Get the most bang for your buck by investing any money that you save monthly by renting instead of owning. Over 40 years, a diversified investment portfolio can yield an equal or even greater return than investing in buying a home. Renting a place doesn’t make you a homeowner, but it does free up cash flow that might otherwise be going to taxes, a mortgage, and unexpected expenses.</p>\n<h3>Make the decision that’s right for you</h3>\n<p>The decision whether to buy or rent a home shouldn’t be made lightly. It should involve being honest with yourself about what you want, what you need, and lists—lots of lists with numbers that will show you the advantages and disadvantages of either decision. Consider your lifestyle, your finances, and your plans. Whatever you decide, make the right decision for <em>you</em>, and don’t worry about what others think.</p>\n<p><em>Now, let’s hear your opinion!

It was the first time I didn’t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn’t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.</p>\n<p>But while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it’s pretty small—at around 500 square feet—and narrow enough that I can’t fit furniture on both sides of the living/dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn’t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.</p>\n<p>I’m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/anxiety-zen/201612/minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health\">feel</a> unburdened in the place that should matter most—home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.</p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>When you have less space to leave things lying around, you can’t afford to have much clutter! Even if you’re not a messy person, it’s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It’s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn’t really want, impulse buys you could’ve done without, and clothing and shoes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don’t want to be looking at your things, especially if it’s miscellaneous stuff you’re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!</p>\n<p>Before you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don’t want or need (<a href=\"https://www.siloam.ca/donate/donate/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE\">Siloam Mission</a> gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you’ll have more room to work with.</p>\n<p>For storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.</p>\n<p>Under the bed is a great place to store items you don’t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.</p>\n<p>If your building has storage lockers, use yours! They’re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.</p>\n<h3>Furniture</h3>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://hutk.ca/\">choosing furniture</a> for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don’t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don’t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.</p>\n<p>Go for <a href=\"http://www.interiorillusions.ca/product-category/furniture/living-room/accent-chairs/\">sleek armless chairs</a>, and try transparent coffee tables, which won’t look like they’re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3430\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3430\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"940\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3430\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by @interior_illusions on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Dual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you’re not using them.</p>\n<p>Look into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you’re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you’re hosting brunch.</p>\n<p>For storing things like books and <a href=\"http://intothemusic.ca/\">records</a>, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You’ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They’re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.</p>\n<p>A TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector—they’re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.</p>\n<h3>Decoration</h3>\n<p>Plants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they’re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered.

Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.</p>\n<p>Hang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame—it’ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.</p>\n<p>When it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>Where do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can’t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don’t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Any tips for decorating a small space?

I began my downtown living journey when I was 19, and I’ve never looked back. Something about downtown caught my interest when I was ready to move from my 130 square foot dormitory into a more grown-up apartment.</p>\n<p>As a young adult, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to create a life in an urban or suburban area. The wonderful thing about downtown Winnipeg is that combines the very best parts of Winnipeg into one neighbourhood! As the years advance and I shuffle between different downtown streets, downtown feels more and more like home.</p>\n<p>Whether you love parks, museums, music venues or creative attractions, downtown Winnipeg has something to make your heart sing. Downtown really optimizes its space with something interesting to see, eat and/or do around every corner.</p>\n<h3>A Mixture of Old and New</h3>\n<p>Downtown mixes the old and the new, showcasing Winnipeg’s attachment to its historical buildings by preserving them, scattered between modernized high rises. The older buildings are comforting and make downtown feel like more than just another concrete jungle. These mature buildings are one of the major reasons why I moved and stayed downtown; they’re full of stories of what Winnipeg used to be like, and how my grandparents and parents lived their lives in these streets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3318\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3318\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Archway at the Grain Exchange, Exchange District, Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-768x512.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1370x913.png 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway.png 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Archway at the Grain Exchange building, Winnipeg</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>You’re Never Hungry</h3>\n<p>Downtown serves as a melting pot, bringing together diverse people into one place—and it really shows through the food! There’s an assortment of eateries, which is great news for foodies like me. You can turn on to any street and be greeted by mom-and-pop bistros, one-of-a-kind cafes, or the familiar chain restaurants you can eat at just about everywhere (which I swear taste better downtown, for some reason). Food and I have a pretty steady relationship, and by living downtown I get the opportunity to experiment with all sorts of flavours!</p>\n<h3>Building Connections</h3>\n<p>Small town living has its romance, but urban living creates intense proximity between you and the people around you. It’s a common misconception that people who live in the heart of cities don’t interact with each other, but I beg to differ! You share laughs with the people at the bus stop as you joke about how Winnipeg Transit buses never seem to arrive on time, make small talk with the folks on the bus that you’re sardined against, groan along with people as you wait in the ridiculously long line at Tim’s, and smile at the person who held the elevator door open for you. These small but meaningful interactions make up the connections of downtown dwellers. You feel that connection because frankly, you can’t help it—you’re always in close proximity to someone.</p>\n<h3>The People Around You</h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that in some cities, downtown can seem cold and unwelcoming. However, I believe that the benefits of urban living can be seen in each unique neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood tells the story of the people who live there, and my neighbourhood downtown is full of people from all walks of life. In my apartment building, my neighbours include a family from across the pond who made me fresh juice when I moved in, an elderly man who gives everyone a Christmas card each year, and a few male university students who shovel the front walkway every winter without being asked. Maybe I’m lucky to know my neighbours, but with the hustle and bustle of downtown life, these types of people really shine a light on downtown Winnipeg’s unique spirit.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsx_u52AA8z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

For example, if you like being in the center of everything, consider streets in the core of downtown Winnipeg. Streets like Graham, Garry and some areas of Portage Avenue are a five-minute walk from popular bars, restaurants and Bell MTS Place.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for somewhere more cosmopolitan, right in the middle of a richly varied area—the Exchange District may be your perfect match! This vibrant neighbourhood boasts many of Winnipeg’s one-of-a-kind boutiques, coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Also, it’s near the Centennial Concert Hall and Winnipeg’s own China Town.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtNESe3AwDL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtNESe3AwDL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by @andrewmahon</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-01-29T03:56:35+00:00\">Jan 28, 2019 at 7:56pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>If you’re interested in a more laid-back neighbourhood that’s still close to entertainment, check out West Broadway. It’s known for being an unofficial boundary between the hustle bustle commercial parts of downtown and the residential areas, so you get the best of both worlds. Backing onto the Assiniboine River, it’s a picturesque area with elm tree canopies over streets and beautiful historic buildings.</p>\n<p>Do some extra exploring around the area to make sure it has your must-haves for a neighbourhood. Keep an eye out for nearby grocery stores, drugstores, and bus stops.</p>\n<p>When walking around the streets outside a potential apartment, do you feel at home? Can you picture yourself showing your friends and family around the streets near the building? That’s a good sign.</p>\n<h3>Size Does Matter</h3>\n<p>When looking for somewhere to call home, you might start to feel like Goldilocks trying to find just the right size. Starting your apartment hunt with your basic space needs figured out will make a world of difference. Consider the following for determining the square feet of your future living space.</p>\n<p>Do you own a lot of larger-scale furniture that needs to be accommodated—such as a pool table, a piano or a bulky sectional sofa? How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you want? Are you the type to spend a ton of time in your bedroom, or do you need a spacious living room? Do you love to host parties and need seating for your entourage?</p>\n<p>If you’re moving from one place to another, you might want to look for something close to the same size. If you are moving into a larger place remember that you’ll have to shell out money to fill it with furniture—an empty apartment just doesn’t feel homey!</p>\n<p>And don’t forget about storage: how much stuff do you need to store? When touring a place or even just looking at a listing on Kijiji, pay attention to the number and size of closets. Look for a bathroom closet, kitchen storage (like cupboards or a pantry) and a coat closet. A lack of storage space can go unnoticed until move-in day when you don’t know where you’re going to store your cleaning supplies or winter coats.</p>\n<h3>Nancy Drew that Apartment</h3>\n<p>There’s nothing worse than moving into an apartment and finding unpleasant surprises in the crooks and crannies, so put on that detective hat. When you view a potential apartment, look closely at ceilings, walls and floors for any cracks, stains or other damage. Check the appliances: open the refrigerator and the oven and try out the sink faucets. Look for signs of wear and tear; these may not be necessarily deal-breakers for you, but something to alert the landlord about so you don’t get dinged on your security deposit.</p>\n<p>Also, check the cellphone reception in every room! Cellphones are a huge part of our lives so make sure you walk around the apartment checking your service bars or sending a quick text or two.</p>\n<h3>Scope out the Neighbours</h3>\n<p>If you pass someone living inside the apartment building you’re touring, say hello! Whether they say hello back, stop to chat or just walk right by will give you an idea of what your potential neighbours are like.</p>\n<p>The perfect neighbours only exist in Hallmark movies, but you do want to feel comfortable with the people around you. It depends on the type of person you are but having neighbours that you can at least smile at in the hallways might be important to you.</p>\n<h3>Identify Must-Have Amenities</h3>\n<p>These are different for everyone, but here are three that we consider deal-breakers:</p>\n<p>A dishwasher: You can theoretically live without a dishwasher—but for the sake of your sanity and the environment, look for an apartment with one.</p>\n<p>An elevator: Stairs may help you with your step counter on your FitBit, but on move-in day, when you’re trying to move your couch up three flights of stairs, you’ll be kicking yourself for renting the place!</p>\n<p>Laundry facilities: Take it from someone who is a serial renter: an on-site laundry room is the holy grail of apartment living. Having to lug all your dirty clothes back and forth from a laundromat is a pain. Do yourself a favour and put a laundry room on your list of non-negotiables.</p>\n<h3>Trust Your Instincts</h3>\n<p>We don&#8217;t call the places where we live home without a reason. If the price is right but something just feels wrong—even if you can’t pinpoint what—trust that feeling and keep searching. The right apartment should be your home base, your personal launchpad for taking on the day and where you can cozy up to recharge.</p>\n<p>Have some pro tips for scoring the perfect apartment?

Walking your dog in the downtown helps you feel like you’re instantly part of a community of dog owners. Dogs are great companions; they’re your best friend, and keep you warm on a cold winter night. On a bad day, a doggie tail wiggle will definitely cheer you up.</p>\n<p>Some people say that having a dog is like having a child. I would say it’s like having a child that <em>never grows up</em>. But as dog lovers know, they’re worth the work! Having a dog while living in an apartment can actually help you stay motivated to get outside. Dogs need exercise, and can develop health problems if they don’t get enough. No one wants their furry friend to get sick!</p>\n<p>So no matter how snowy, cold, rainy, or hot it is outside, you put a leash on your excited dog and get yourself outside. Sometimes it’s eye-wateringly early and you’re dreaming about your warm bed, but Fido needs his walk. And as a bonus, you get to enjoy as much fresh air and physical activity as your pet! (Ever notice how fit some dog owners are?)</p>\n<p>But here’s the problem: Your dog is all excited about going out to see the big world, but you have no idea where to go or what route to take this time. You’re in luck: here’s a list of 5 beautiful places and parks in Winnipeg within a 20-minute walk of 300 Main Street:</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrTa1dpAcvV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrTa1dpAcvV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by David Metcalfe (@davidmetclfe)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-12T22:06:15+00:00\">Dec 12, 2018 at 2:06pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.winnipeg.ca/PublicWorks/parksOpenSpace/OffLeashDogParks/DTDogPark.stm\">Bonnycastle Dog Park</a></strong>. The park is just a 12-minute walk from 300 Main Street. It’s located in the beautiful Assiniboine Avenue area, right across from the <a href=\"https://www.fortgarryhotel.com/\">Fort Garry Hotel</a>. I love spending summer days here, just walking around and seeing happy dog owners playing with their pets! The park even has a bottle-refill fountain that operates in the hot summer months. Bonnycastle Park was opened in February 2016 and has become very popular with downtown doggies. The off-leash park is fully fenced and has almost 13,000 square feet of playing area. Its design includes artificial turf that was specifically designed for dog parks. Take your dog to Bonnycastle dog park—I promise you both will enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>2.<a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\"> The Forks</a>.</strong> You can’t let your dog go off-leash in this heritage area, but why not combine your dog walk with some entertainment for yourself? The Forks is just a 9-minute walk away from 300 Main Street. In the summertime, wander around with an ice cream in one hand and dog’s leash in the other while listening to buskers. In the wintertime, enjoy Christmas lights, watch people skate and absorb the joyful holiday vibes. Keep in mind that the Forks can get very crowded during festivals; unless your furry friend is very used to big crowds of people, you might want to avoid busy days.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc6VNxqjs2x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc6VNxqjs2x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">every time I visit this place I make a new friend</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/93mp/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Winnipeg</a> (@93mp) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-12-20T04:56:37+00:00\">Dec 19, 2017 at 8:56pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/business/central-park/\">Central Park</a>.</strong> This park is not an off-leash dog park, but pet owners love it anyway. After a 17-minute walk away from downtown, you can stroll in a peaceful place surrounded by historical architecture. The park is also a good place for a relaxing pause if you and your dog walked for a long time and need some rest. Bring a book and settle in on a bench to enjoy a relaxing day in the park.</p>\n<p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/pdf_folder/WaterfrontDriveExpectations.pdf\">Waterfront Drive</a>.</strong> This is one of my favourite areas in Winnipeg because it combines historical and brand-new buildings with a wide sidewalk through the park. Taking a walk here feels like wandering through a picturesque forest. Dog owners, bikers, and joggers share the walking route at Waterfront Drive. The sidewalk is paved, wide, and well maintained, and runs right beside the mighty Red River. It’s a lovely place to have some quality time by yourself, with a good friend, or with your dog.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The Legislative Grounds.</strong> The park around the monumental <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a> is easily one of the best in Winnipeg for walking with your dog. The Legislative Grounds are a bit further from 300 Main, clocking in at 21 minutes at a walking pace, but it’s worth the extra effort. It’s peaceful right in the middle of the city, and it’s always full of dogs and their owners enjoying some time together. Personally, I believe the Legislative Grounds are so popular because it feels like time stands still there. As soon as you walk into the park and see the Legislative Building, you slow down, and a strong feeling of being part of history overcomes you. Seriously—just put a leash on your dog and go experience it for yourself. Just forget about your cell phone in your pocket, and lift your eyes to the ledges of the Manitoba Legislative Building.

It can also be lonely, so some of us choose to have roommates for companionship. Whatever your reasons might be, living with roommates can be a lovely—or disastrous—experience.</p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<p>Splitting living costs means you have more money for other things. You can also create great memories with roommates. I’ve had roomies off and on in my life, particularly in my university years. One of my favourite aspects of living with others is the meshing of traditions and cultures around the holidays. One year, three of us celebrated Christmas and two celebrated Hanukkah. We decided to mash everything together and made a Chrismukkah tree. It was a traditional Christmas evergreen tree, but we covered it in blue and silver decorations (the colours of Hannukah) and used a big Star of David as a tree topper. It was fun watching the roomies who’d never had a tree try to figure out how to hang balls and baubles, as those little squeezable hooks aren’t really used for anything but Christmas decorations. We also got to teach our roommates all of the lyrics to cheesy Christmas songs. And later that school year, I learned how to celebrate Passover. We always enjoyed our combined holiday events.</p>\n<p>Being students, we had lots of silly drunken nights and sometimes came up with imaginative solutions to our problems. We had been given a TV by one set of parents, but it had no remote control. We were entirely too lazy to get up and change the channel, so one night we found some duct tape and taped all of our wooden spoons and spatulas together in a long line that reached from the couch to the TV. It served as a handy, and remarkably sturdy, remote control for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And having roommates means there is often someone there to talk to and do things with without having to schedule plans days in advance, which is a nice bonus.</p>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<p>Having roomies isn’t always idyllic. Living with others is often fraught with annoyances and drama. One of the most common fights is over cleanliness, or lack thereof. I’m sure our bathrooms were teeming with germs, as no one ever wanted to clean them. We had the same problem with dishes. No one ever believed it was their turn to wash, so the dishes just piled up in the sink in ever-teetering towers.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2955\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2955\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2955\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png\" alt=\"dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-500x340.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-300x204.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-768x522.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by rawpixel on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Your best bet to avoid similar problems is to have a conversation with your roomies right at the start, to decide what is and isn’t acceptable for everyone. You may also want to create a chore schedule so everyone knows exactly who will be doing what and by when.</p>\n<p>Another issue can be sharing food or other resources. You should decide right away if you are sharing food or keeping things completely separate. This does not guarantee success, by the way. We had one roommate in university (I’m calling her Jane to protect the guilty) who never bought her own food and pilfered from everyone else when we weren’t around. It wasn’t something we were able to successfully stop, and it was one of the reasons she ended up moving out before the year was up.</p>\n<h3>The Ugly</h3>\n<p>Some problems grow from small to breathtakingly bad. We had one roommate (surprisingly, not Jane) come back from summer break in second year with a large package in tow. She worked on her parents’ travelling carnival every summer. That year, she had fallen for a 6’8” carny and decided to bring him back to university with her. He was supposed to stay a few days, maybe a week or two, before finding his own place. He never left. He spent the entire year living with us, moving from job to job, and never contributed anything towards rent or utilities. It was an ongoing fight all year to get him to pay up or move out, but we didn’t get the big mooch to leave until we all moved out at the end of the school year.</p>\n<p>Most roommate situations don’t turn out this badly, but it’s important to know something about the person you are living with and to set clear ground rules from the start. It’s no fun if you suddenly find yourself in need of a new living situation because things have become untenable at home.</p>\n<h3>And the Downright Weird</h3>\n<p>Some roommate situations just become weird. Like Jane, who had a revolving door of friends constantly in our apartment. It’s a little disconcerting to walk into your bathroom at 7 am and find some guy you’ve never met before passed out over your toilet. (Hello, awkward conversation.)</p>\n<p>In our student apartment building, people regularly set off the fire alarm with burned popcorn and toast. But when Jane decided it would be a great idea to butt a cigarette into a wastebasket full of paper, the ensuing full-fledged fire didn’t set off the alarms until our apartment was fully consumed by smoke. Most of the damage was contained to her room, but the entire apartment had a distinctly smoky smell for weeks after. I guess my tip here is to choose your roommates wisely.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2957\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2957\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2957\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky notes, delegating, tasks, communication, assertive, apartment living, downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-500x331.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-768x509.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1370x907.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2957\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>There are benefits and drawbacks both to living alone and with others.
