Give her a unique and timeless gift this Mother’s Day by making her the perfect year-round wreath!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ideas out there for this one, from the more traditional to the out of the flower box ideas. This is a very versatile gift idea. These are great because you can tailor them to her taste and decor, and no one knows your mom’s style better than you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fabric wreaths</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your mom is the fun, creative type, this is a perfect choice. Make a wreath that matches whatever space your mom is proudly going to want to display it. A great option is using handkerchiefs and pocket scarves as they are an easy-to-find, affordable, and one-of-a-kind idea when it comes to making a wreath.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"907\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7788\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1.jpg 907w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-300x249.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-770x639.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-293x243.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-500x415.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-72x60.jpg 72w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-secret-garden-931158-1-108x90.jpg 108w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great DIY gift idea you can customize for your mom that she will love is a flower box bouquet. Show your mom not only how much she means to you but how well you know her with a personalized bouquet. Nothing says Happy Mother’s Day like realizing their baby really does know and love them back (almost) as much as they know and love us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show your mom how much you with a personalized bouquet. These personalized DIY bouquets are a perfect fit for Mother’s Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crystal Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or your mom is into crystals, this is a great idea. Not only is it sentimental to put it into a bouquet, but crystals are also incredibly beautiful and personal when it comes from the right person. If your mom likes crystals, the great idea is to go to a holistic store (or order a set on amazon) and pick out a few of your favorite crystals that you know your Mom would love. This is one of the most affordable yet thoughtful ideas when it comes to the DIY gift department.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"927\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7786\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644.jpg 927w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4040644-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure what a crystal is or what to buy, here are some suggestions that fit the energy of Mother’s Day. It is never a bad idea to grab some dried herbs and fresh flowers to throw in and fill the spaces and really make your bouquet complete. You can go to your local metaphysical store or order them online from many holistic realters (amazon included). The great thing about these bouquets is you can make them specific to your mom&#8217;s life, needs, and personality. If you are not quite sure where to start with the crystals and do not want to ruin the surprise by asking her yourself, here are some fail-safe favorites she will definitely love:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Rose Quartz</li><li>Amethyst</li><li>Citrine</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Turquoise</li><li>Clear Quartz</li><li>Tigers Eye</li><li>Rainbow Fluorite</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edible Bouquets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another delicious bouquet idea is an edible bouquet! If you ask any mom, they would probably rather have chocolates than actual flowers. A traditional gift like flowers is a nice thought, but they wilt all too soon. Give your Mother’s Day gift a tasty appetizer with a chocolate or cookie bouquet, picked fresh for your own Mom&#8217;s taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7785\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908.jpg 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andres-ayrton-6578908-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great and easy thing to pull off, no matter your DIY skill, because baking is optional. Put together some of your mom’s favorite cookies, chocolates, and other treats and arrange them in her own “snack bouquet.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Photo Bouquet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A great bouquet option that you can personalize with your mom is a photo bouquet! Print out some of your favorite photos of your mom or you and her together, and turn them into a personal bouquet! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"778\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7784\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1.jpg 778w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-samer-daboul-1226721-1-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>She will certainly love the thought and personality put behind it and the fact that she has printouts of the two of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DIY Self Care Box</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moms work way too hard even now that we grow older; our moms are still able to grace us with their motherly wisdom at every text and call.

You can find fun ideas and more in-depth instructions online, but making a candle is as easy as 1-2-3-.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pick out your wax, wick, and smell.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The ingredients of a candle are your wax, the wick, the essential oils, and of course, your jar. You can get these online or at any craft store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Prepare</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is melt the wax, mix, and set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melt your wax either directly or through a double boiler system. Once the wax is melted, mix in your essential oils. Whatever method, wax, and size of candle you choose will determine how much you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Package</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that your wax and essential oils are combined, you want to get ready to fill the jar and set the wick. Slowly pour the melted wax and oil into the jar with the wick and let it set. Within 24-48 hours, you will have a personal, beautiful candle ready for your Mother’s Day gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"917\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7781\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879.jpg 917w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-anna-shvets-5760879-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mom is bound to love any one of these DIY gifts or any other idea you may come up with. When it comes to Mother’s Day, many of us stress about how to best show our moms just how much we appreciate everything they do. A DIY gift is not only easy on your budget but is loving, personal, and bound to show mom exactly how much her answering every little question about laundry and cooking does mean to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to our moms, no one means more to us. It may feel hard to express the level of gratitude you have for everything she does for you. When it comes to gift-giving to your mom, nothing says I love you more than a gift that says, &#8220;I spent time on this,&#8221; and a DIY gift package will scream exactly that. These DIY gifts are amazing alone, or you can mix some of them, and they can also serve you for any other occasion.

I think it’s safe to say it’s not in most of ours. But it happens. Then suddenly, your life is in upheaval and your vision for the future needs to change. It’s stressful and kind of scary. And it sucks. But, it can also be an exciting opportunity to establish the new and improved, independent you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mondo checkbox on that to-do list is finding your new home. It’s a pretty daunting task. For most of us, being at home makes us feel comfortable and safe. If you don’t have that refuge to return to, or it’s full of reminders of your past life, well, it can make a tough time even harder. But it <em>is </em>possible, and even manageable. <em>You’ve got this.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that if I can do it, you can too. It won’t be easy, but you’ll be back on your feet in no time. Remember though, every situation is unique. Assess your circumstances and then tackle those hurdles as only you can!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you do anything else, you’ve got to answer this all important question:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s your budget?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A budget is <em>integral</em> to starting things off right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re going from living with a spouse and splitting the expenses to living on your own, you’re going to need to reassess your finances. Depending on your situation, this may drastically affect your standard of living (harsh, but true).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break down your monthly income and your current expenses. Which are non-negotiable? Which can be reduced? And when in doubt, round up! If you always count on socking away a little extra, the surplus will help to cover any unexpected expenses that crop up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a ballpark figure, about 30% of your monthly income is going toward rent. Depending on your earnings and your housing needs, that number might be even higher. In the quest for your new address, be sure to consider what utilities and amenities are included &#8211; a higher monthly payment might be worth it if it covers your electric bill and gym membership too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve run the numbers and you’re going to be hard pressed to make ends meet, <em>don’t panic</em>. There is social support in place for this situation you may qualify for. Those in Manitoba can find out more through the 2-1-1 phone line or website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know how much you’re prepared to spend, it’s time to hit the bricks (or the search engine).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6801\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-300x203.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-770x521.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-293x198.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-500x338.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1.jpg 1338w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding a place</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like with any important decision: take your time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another way of saying <strong>don’t take the first thing that comes along</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re eager to get out of this limbo and on with your life! But it’s worth it to look around and weigh your options (especially remembering some ‌places I considered &#8211; yikes!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do you want a place that fits your budget, you want something that fits your lifestyle. Somewhere you can reclaim that safe and comfortable environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short term, I recommend renting as opposed to buying for two main reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>&nbsp; &#8211; Right now your future is uncertain. A lease gives you the option to adjust your plans as circumstances evolve. Plus, it’s easier to find something that fits your budget.</li><li><strong>Convenience &#8211; </strong>You have enough to deal with without worrying about replacing appliances or building and yard maintenance! Instead, you can plunk yourself in a central location with easy access to whatever amenities you need.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>My downtown apartment was the perfect haven, with easy access to transit, restaurants, parks and entertainment. It had everything I needed to let me hunker down and put myself back together again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re searching the streets for vacancy signs, try not to worry about landing something&nbsp; before the month closes. If possible, shack up with a friend or even your Mom for a few weeks while you get your house in order (literally and figuratively). This gets you out of your old place into a transitory state. You’ll be more motivated to find a pad of your own <em>and</em> it gets you out of your old place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can check into short-term leases. If you need a place to recoup for a month or two before you sign a long-term lease, these can provide temporary asylum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The local Rental Guide, classifieds, internet searches and prowling the pavement are all great ways to get a beat on lucrative places for rent. Check them out and see what your options are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your new home is where you’re going to begin the next chapter of your life, it’s okay to take a bit of time to figure out something that fits you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ok, so you’ve found a place. Now what?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Out with the old in with the you!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things about divorce? Getting to choose your own aesthetic. Now’s your chance to design your space in a way that reflects <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purge the items that don’t fit anymore &#8211; both emotionally and physically. Throw the wedding pictures in storage, and swap that too big, memory ridden furniture for something that fits your space and your style. Whether you’re trawling department stores or thrift shops, it’s refreshing to pick out some new pieces you love.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Plan for Plants!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>People are happier with plants around. It’s almost like we do better with other living things nearby! (We do, that’s science.) I don’t pretend to understand <em>why </em>exactly having plants makes you feel better, but they reduce stress and improve your mood just by being there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not a plant person, you have options. Have you considered a spider plant? Even I managed not to kill that. Or, check out these out articles to find your fit:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/finding-your-houseplant-match/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Finding your houseplant match</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/which-plants-grow-best-in-your-apartment-making-your-apartment-greener/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Make your apartment greener</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Potentially pets</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6802\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-770x518.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-293x197.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-500x336.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s already you and your furry friend against the world, you’re set. But if not, you may want to take up cat-sitting, because like plants, we’re happier with animals around. You might even look into fostering or adopting a pet of your own!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caring for and having the company of animals can be rewarding and fulfilling. But think carefully before adopting a pet &#8211; it’s a big commitment. If your life is already in turmoil, heaping more responsibility onto your plate may not be the best idea. It adds extra complexity such as ensuring your new abode is pet friendly, and paying additional damage deposits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, having an animal around is super therapeutic because, well, they’re often cuddly and adorable. Plus the previously mentioned scientifically backed benefits of other living things! You’ve got options though &#8211; there are lots of programs in need of good foster homes for animals while they wait for adoption, or you can volunteer your time at the shelters themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, definitely crash your friend’s next trip to the dog park!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Get to know your neighbourhood</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re in a new place with all kinds of new things to discover! It can be a little intimidating, and you may still be mourning the loss of your favorite coffee shop, but getting out and about in your neighbourhood has multiple benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, it’s important that you actually get up and leave your place occasionally, even if you don’t want to. Being outside is <em>another </em>of those scientifically backed well-being things. Plus, how else are you going to find the local restaurant with the best patio?? (Besides on the internet &#8211; you need to go check it out!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting familiar with your new surroundings is a <em>huge</em> step toward quelling that out-of-place feeling. You’ll start recognizing the local baristas and it will ‌become more and more like home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remember: Everything is going to be OK</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6803\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-500x375.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It might take a while, but over time things will begin to feel normal again. In the meantime, it’s okay <em>not </em>to be okay. Lean on your friends and family, talk to a therapist, dispose of that pair of your ex’s underwear you found, preferably in a needlessly spectacular and ruthless fashion. Do what you need to do to get through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divorce is cruddy, but it’s also the start of something new. Things won’t ever be the same, but there are plenty of reasons you don’t want them to be. By taking the time to prepare and find a place that provides what you need, you’ll have a new home base and foundation off which to launch. Having the comfort of a home that embodies <em>you</em> will provide the safety and structure you need to heal and start the next leg of your journey.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, divorce wasn’t exactly in your life plan.

Here are three reasons why I think it’s important and healthy for young people to move out of their parents’ home and start living on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 1:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Show your family—and yourself—that you’re ready to be more mature&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-chores-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6542\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-chores-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re moving out for freedom, room to grow, or just a more convenient location, living on your own requires some life skills and emotional maturity. Living on your own, you learn to rely on yourself to overcome challenges. You’ll learn how&nbsp;to manage finances, space, time, and, most importantly, how to deal with unpleasant situations.&nbsp;These are some of the&nbsp;best teachers out there to teach&nbsp;a young person maturity and independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I moved out for college, the first few days were full of delightful hours of organizing my place and thinking about all the fun I could have living on my own. Then came the realization that it wasn’t all going to be fun, and I had a lot of new things to learn: new lessons&nbsp;that&nbsp;I am grateful for, but&nbsp;were not what I expected.&nbsp;I can’t count how many times I thought about giving it all up and moving back in with my parents.&nbsp;However, times of&nbsp;instability turned&nbsp;me into a&nbsp;more&nbsp;mature person and allowed me&nbsp;to see myself in a new light, which wouldn’t have happened in&nbsp;the comfort of my parents&#8217; house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 2:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Give yourself the freedom you need to grow&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"707\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-freedom-1024x707.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6543\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-300x207.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-770x532.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1536x1061.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-2048x1414.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-293x202.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-1400x967.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-freedom-500x345.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, we all need more&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;and freedom of choice than we can usually find living with our parents.&nbsp;No matter how loving&nbsp;and understanding your&nbsp;parents are,&nbsp;one day&nbsp;a bedroom starts feeling too tight&nbsp;and you start to crave a bigger, more private space.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;not&nbsp;just&nbsp;about the square footage;&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;about the ability to&nbsp;cook&nbsp;and watch&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;you want,&nbsp;and to invite&nbsp;over&nbsp;whoever&nbsp;you want, whenever you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I had to learn some harsh lessons along the way,&nbsp;living on my own expanded my creative ideas in terms of interior design, and my social skills when it came to hosting my parties. After years of living and studying under my parents’&nbsp;intent&nbsp;gaze, moving out allowed me to live as I wanted without interrupting the plans of others.&nbsp;I had the space I needed to find my self—and to have yogurt for dinner if I wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reason 3:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Learn responsibility&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6544\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/300main-responsibility-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Living on your own teaches responsibility like nothing else!&nbsp;Parents tend to see&nbsp;their children as little kids&nbsp;who require constant protection,&nbsp;no matter what age they already are. They just can’t help but&nbsp;protect and take as much care as they can to provide a comfortable and carefree&nbsp;life for their kids.&nbsp;Home-cooked meals together,&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean house, set schedule,&nbsp;and no need to think about&nbsp;finances&nbsp;are wonderful for a child, but eventually that child becomes a young adult who needs to live on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving out and dealing with all of these things on your own is like a crash-course in responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My whole&nbsp;being&nbsp;disagreed with the fact that mama was&nbsp;no longer near, and she would not take care of me waking up on time and having a healthy breakfast. The first few months&nbsp;of living on my own&nbsp;were like&nbsp;a nightmare where chores fell on my head with no warning.&nbsp;Eventually, I learned it all and developed new habits. A&nbsp;clean house,&nbsp;reasonable wake-up time, finished homework, and my full stomach were consequences of responsible actions I had to take on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By living on my own,&nbsp;I learned essential things that I would&nbsp;never have learned living with my parents.&nbsp;It made me more responsible, more mature, and allowed me to understand myself better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now, tell us your story of leaving the nest or living on your own for the first time!

Start With Your Neighbours!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Networking—a fancy term for a simple idea. Meet people, interact with them and build new relationships. We’re so used to networking through social media that the thought of physically interacting with people might sound a little bit alien. You could have 300 people on your <a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> network, another 300 on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>, and not know any of them well enough to know where they are from. Friendly relations between neighbours encourages real-life networking, and as old school as it may sound, it’s so valuable. Everyone has a story to tell, and you would probably miss the most interesting chapters if you had the same conversation online.</p>\n<p>Humans are social by nature; we need to have meaningful conversations with other people to satisfy our natural instinct to know one another. Community meet-ups and common areas encourage networking with those around us. Networking doesn’t necessarily mean meeting with influential people who can help you professionally; it can also include people you can really connect with on an intellectual level. Many apartment buildings have common areas so people can lounge and get to know each other. Events like BBQs, pool parties, breakfasts and evening tea encourage tenants to get familiar with each other. While these events may seem like just a casual breakfast (free food!), they’re also opportunities to discuss concerns and get valuable information. For example, downtown apartment dwellers might be happy to learn about the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/safety/watch-ambassadors/\">Downtown Watch Ambassadors</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwK8cMVg5YP/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwK8cMVg5YP/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-04-12T21:43:42+00:00\">Apr 12, 2019 at 2:43pm PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></center></p>\n<p>Networking isn’t just about advancing your career; it’s also about bonds between neighbours, an important part of apartment living. Being on good terms with your neighbours means you have someone to turn to in case of an emergency, or just to call over for a cup of tea if you’re having a bad day and need someone to talk to. You can surround yourself with people you trust who can eventually become part of your support system. Good neighbours can end up feeling like family when you’re living alone.</p>\n<p>The great thing about downtown Winnipeg is the strong sense of community that the area promotes. Most apartment buildings are designed to have spaces for general use. Downtown boasts wonderful cultural diversity, making networking even more fun! You can get to know people from varied backgrounds, find out first-hand details about other cultures, and learn about entirely different ways of life.</p>\n<p>My apartment building used to have the best BBQ parties for tenants where we would all just chat; it was fun to find out that I had a police officer and ballet dancer living on the same floor as me. At one BBQ, I saw a distinguished-looking gentleman hand over his business card to a student looking for an internship. It felt so good to be living in a community where people were looking out for each other and helping out where they could. These meet-ups can even help recent immigrants build their social circles and meet new people.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4665 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/alexis-brown-85793-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"New to Networking?

I began my downtown living journey when I was 19, and I’ve never looked back. Something about downtown caught my interest when I was ready to move from my 130 square foot dormitory into a more grown-up apartment.</p>\n<p>As a young adult, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to create a life in an urban or suburban area. The wonderful thing about downtown Winnipeg is that combines the very best parts of Winnipeg into one neighbourhood! As the years advance and I shuffle between different downtown streets, downtown feels more and more like home.</p>\n<p>Whether you love parks, museums, music venues or creative attractions, downtown Winnipeg has something to make your heart sing. Downtown really optimizes its space with something interesting to see, eat and/or do around every corner.</p>\n<h3>A Mixture of Old and New</h3>\n<p>Downtown mixes the old and the new, showcasing Winnipeg’s attachment to its historical buildings by preserving them, scattered between modernized high rises. The older buildings are comforting and make downtown feel like more than just another concrete jungle. These mature buildings are one of the major reasons why I moved and stayed downtown; they’re full of stories of what Winnipeg used to be like, and how my grandparents and parents lived their lives in these streets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3318\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3318\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Archway at the Grain Exchange, Exchange District, Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-768x512.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1370x913.png 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway.png 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Archway at the Grain Exchange building, Winnipeg</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>You’re Never Hungry</h3>\n<p>Downtown serves as a melting pot, bringing together diverse people into one place—and it really shows through the food! There’s an assortment of eateries, which is great news for foodies like me. You can turn on to any street and be greeted by mom-and-pop bistros, one-of-a-kind cafes, or the familiar chain restaurants you can eat at just about everywhere (which I swear taste better downtown, for some reason). Food and I have a pretty steady relationship, and by living downtown I get the opportunity to experiment with all sorts of flavours!</p>\n<h3>Building Connections</h3>\n<p>Small town living has its romance, but urban living creates intense proximity between you and the people around you. It’s a common misconception that people who live in the heart of cities don’t interact with each other, but I beg to differ! You share laughs with the people at the bus stop as you joke about how Winnipeg Transit buses never seem to arrive on time, make small talk with the folks on the bus that you’re sardined against, groan along with people as you wait in the ridiculously long line at Tim’s, and smile at the person who held the elevator door open for you. These small but meaningful interactions make up the connections of downtown dwellers. You feel that connection because frankly, you can’t help it—you’re always in close proximity to someone.</p>\n<h3>The People Around You</h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that in some cities, downtown can seem cold and unwelcoming. However, I believe that the benefits of urban living can be seen in each unique neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood tells the story of the people who live there, and my neighbourhood downtown is full of people from all walks of life. In my apartment building, my neighbours include a family from across the pond who made me fresh juice when I moved in, an elderly man who gives everyone a Christmas card each year, and a few male university students who shovel the front walkway every winter without being asked. Maybe I’m lucky to know my neighbours, but with the hustle and bustle of downtown life, these types of people really shine a light on downtown Winnipeg’s unique spirit.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsx_u52AA8z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It can also be lonely, so some of us choose to have roommates for companionship. Whatever your reasons might be, living with roommates can be a lovely—or disastrous—experience.</p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<p>Splitting living costs means you have more money for other things. You can also create great memories with roommates. I’ve had roomies off and on in my life, particularly in my university years. One of my favourite aspects of living with others is the meshing of traditions and cultures around the holidays. One year, three of us celebrated Christmas and two celebrated Hanukkah. We decided to mash everything together and made a Chrismukkah tree. It was a traditional Christmas evergreen tree, but we covered it in blue and silver decorations (the colours of Hannukah) and used a big Star of David as a tree topper. It was fun watching the roomies who’d never had a tree try to figure out how to hang balls and baubles, as those little squeezable hooks aren’t really used for anything but Christmas decorations. We also got to teach our roommates all of the lyrics to cheesy Christmas songs. And later that school year, I learned how to celebrate Passover. We always enjoyed our combined holiday events.</p>\n<p>Being students, we had lots of silly drunken nights and sometimes came up with imaginative solutions to our problems. We had been given a TV by one set of parents, but it had no remote control. We were entirely too lazy to get up and change the channel, so one night we found some duct tape and taped all of our wooden spoons and spatulas together in a long line that reached from the couch to the TV. It served as a handy, and remarkably sturdy, remote control for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And having roommates means there is often someone there to talk to and do things with without having to schedule plans days in advance, which is a nice bonus.</p>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<p>Having roomies isn’t always idyllic. Living with others is often fraught with annoyances and drama. One of the most common fights is over cleanliness, or lack thereof. I’m sure our bathrooms were teeming with germs, as no one ever wanted to clean them. We had the same problem with dishes. No one ever believed it was their turn to wash, so the dishes just piled up in the sink in ever-teetering towers.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2955\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2955\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2955\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png\" alt=\"dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-500x340.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-300x204.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-768x522.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by rawpixel on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Your best bet to avoid similar problems is to have a conversation with your roomies right at the start, to decide what is and isn’t acceptable for everyone. You may also want to create a chore schedule so everyone knows exactly who will be doing what and by when.</p>\n<p>Another issue can be sharing food or other resources. You should decide right away if you are sharing food or keeping things completely separate. This does not guarantee success, by the way. We had one roommate in university (I’m calling her Jane to protect the guilty) who never bought her own food and pilfered from everyone else when we weren’t around. It wasn’t something we were able to successfully stop, and it was one of the reasons she ended up moving out before the year was up.</p>\n<h3>The Ugly</h3>\n<p>Some problems grow from small to breathtakingly bad. We had one roommate (surprisingly, not Jane) come back from summer break in second year with a large package in tow. She worked on her parents’ travelling carnival every summer. That year, she had fallen for a 6’8” carny and decided to bring him back to university with her. He was supposed to stay a few days, maybe a week or two, before finding his own place. He never left. He spent the entire year living with us, moving from job to job, and never contributed anything towards rent or utilities. It was an ongoing fight all year to get him to pay up or move out, but we didn’t get the big mooch to leave until we all moved out at the end of the school year.</p>\n<p>Most roommate situations don’t turn out this badly, but it’s important to know something about the person you are living with and to set clear ground rules from the start. It’s no fun if you suddenly find yourself in need of a new living situation because things have become untenable at home.</p>\n<h3>And the Downright Weird</h3>\n<p>Some roommate situations just become weird. Like Jane, who had a revolving door of friends constantly in our apartment. It’s a little disconcerting to walk into your bathroom at 7 am and find some guy you’ve never met before passed out over your toilet. (Hello, awkward conversation.)</p>\n<p>In our student apartment building, people regularly set off the fire alarm with burned popcorn and toast. But when Jane decided it would be a great idea to butt a cigarette into a wastebasket full of paper, the ensuing full-fledged fire didn’t set off the alarms until our apartment was fully consumed by smoke. Most of the damage was contained to her room, but the entire apartment had a distinctly smoky smell for weeks after. I guess my tip here is to choose your roommates wisely.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2957\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2957\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2957\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky notes, delegating, tasks, communication, assertive, apartment living, downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-500x331.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-768x509.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1370x907.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2957\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>There are benefits and drawbacks both to living alone and with others. You need to pick the option that best works for you. If you have roommates, spend a little time making the right choice or you could spend a lot of time regretting it. Set clear ground rules and expectations, and be prepared to have frank discussions when things don’t run smoothly. This happens sometimes, even with great roommates. And if you have some bad experiences, remind yourself they make great fodder for party stories later.

You’re in the heart of the city with oodles of entertainment choices right outside your door. In your new digs at 300 Main, you will also have new neighbours, maybe more than you’ve ever had before. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>As adults, we sometimes have trouble making new friends and even introducing ourselves to others. Do you want your neighbours to be more than just nameless faces but don’t know where to start? If so, here are five ideas that just may get you started in meeting those sharing your new living environment. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Join the Gym</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>At 300 Main, you’ve got some swanky new amenities, including a gym. There are many good reasons to use these facilities, the most obvious of which are exercise and healthy living. Yes, you could work out in your apartment, but you won’t meet anyone new there. The gym will give you an opportunity to politely check out and maybe meet some of your neighbours. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1438523886290140&#038;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></center></p>\n<p>It can be easier to introduce yourself to someone in the gym, because you already have something in common: a desire to exercise. This gives you a ready-made topic to discuss. Does your possible new bestie have a favourite piece of equipment or a good workout tip? Starting with this type of safe topic gives you a chance to chat and discover if you might have more in common. If they don’t seem like buddy material, stick to your short exercise chat, then go back to working out. Having exercise to do gives you an easy excuse to extract yourself from a conversation that isn’t going well. (The introverted among us always like having an escape plan from awkward conversation.) Remember, less is more. You don’t want to be the pushy type, so don’t monopolize anyone for too long.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If your first conversation goes well, you can try to catch this person on the regular at the gym for a while. If you both seem receptive to talking outside of the gym, suggest going for drinks or coffee, something comfortable and short.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Friends-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-1370x913.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>Join a Social Event or Start a Social Committee</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-225\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-500x374.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-300x224.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-768x574.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1370x1024.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />Does your building hold any social events onsite or organize any group outings? If yes, consider joining one that interests you. If you don’t see any options for social gatherings, consider starting a social committee yourself. You will likely need to talk to building management first, but group outings are another great way to meet people in low-stress situations and see if you have something in common.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>You can also join or start a charitable endeavour in your building. There are many non-profit organizations located downtown, such as<i> Siloam Mission</i><i> </i>or<i> Welcome Place</i>, which have volunteer openings.  Alternatively, you could invite your apartment block or floor to raise money as a community. Organizations like the Christmas Cheer Board are always looking for new donors. Any of these options will create an opportunity for you to meet people and help a worthy cause at the same time. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Start a Conversation in Common Areas</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Inevitably, you will see some of your new neighbours in the hall, on the elevator or in the mailroom. One of the easiest ways to meet your neighbours is to pipe up and introduce yourself in these situations. If you’re an extrovert, starting conversations with complete strangers is likely an easy task for you. If you’re an introvert, this will take more effort. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Start with a smile and avoid coming on too strong. Remember, you’ve already got something in common: you live in the same building! Ask what they think of the building, the gym or some other amenity. This should lead to an easy conversation. Chances are good you can converse on this topic for a few minutes, which is all you will have (at most) when you randomly run into people in your building. Remember to give your name and, if you feel comfortable, what floor you live on. You won’t hit it off with every neighbour, so don’t fret if the first few conversations don’t work out. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Advanced Technique</b><b>: Throw a Party!</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>If you’re a sociable sort and like to plan events, consider throwing a party. This might be especially welcome if everyone on the invitee list is new to the building, since most of us like to make friends. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>It’s best to invite a smallish number of people to a party, maybe everyone on your floor. You can knock on doors, leave messages under doors or invite people you’ve met and with whom you have already exchanged numbers.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Keep the event low key and don’t try to make people do party games. Be conscientious and keep the volume down. Not everyone will come and you don’t want to tick off the people who share your building. The party could just be an easy brunch (mimosas!) or after work drinks. You don’t have to plan for a six-hour event. If all goes well, you might make a few friends. At least you will have some friendly new acquaintances you can talk to when moving around your building.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Think</b><b> </b><b>Beyond Your Building</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\">It’s great to know people right in your living space, but you don’t have to limit yourself to one spot. Take advantage of your location to meet other downtown denizens. You can try local coffee shops or nightclubs. If you pick a regular time to visit your favourite coffee haunt, you might spot other regulars</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\"> and be spotted by them</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\">. It will be less intimidating to start conversations with people who have seen your face a few times.</span></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-187 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/meetup.en_-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-300x158.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-500x263.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-768x403.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-1024x538.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-1370x719.png 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>You can also look for local organizations to join. There are multiple Toastmasters clubs that meet downtown. You can also check out <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">www.meetup.com</a> to find information about groups or events downtown that might interest you. You can visit the Millennium Library or sign up for some volunteer work in your neighbourhood. There are so many options for meeting people downtown. Pick one and take the plunge!<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Starting Is Often the Hardest Part</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Meeting people and making new friends can take some work and some intentionality. Choose not to keep your head down over your phone when you’re in your building.  Show your neighbours you are open to connecting by smiling, making eye contact, and saying “hi” when you can. The truth is, many people are shy and just need an invitation to strike up a conversation.  Before long, you’ll discover that “renters” have become “neighbours”, and “neighbours” have become friends. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Downtown living can be exciting.
