A great pair of waterproof boots or shoes will make all the difference when it comes to beating the weather and still looking great going from outside to inside. You want to make sure that you choose shoes that are made waterproof to avoid damaging a great pair that isn&#8217;t made to withstand the spring conditions. Most pairs of waterproof shoes are made to resist the snow and slush without damaging the fabric, even without a shoe protector, but you still don&#8217;t want to skip out on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"902\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7755\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918.png 902w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-900x602.png 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-harrison-haines-3070918-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shoe Protector</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what pair of shoes fits your personal style, make sure you keep them protected from the conditions too. Even though most pairs of waterproof shoes can be worn without a protective spray, no problem, when it comes to the fact that you are going through slush and rain, you do want to do what you can to help keep them in the best condition for as long as possible. Using a protecting spray and cleanser that is made for your shoe material will help them resist wear and tear and prevent the fabric from salt and water damage, keeping them looking fresh year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mukluks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mukluks are a popular choice in Winnipeg for very good reason. Not only are the traditional Moccasin made perfect for any of Manitoba&#8217;s conditions, but they also look great and keep you dry and warm in any season. They are great because the rubber sole and waterproof fabrics are made to get you through the worst that mother nature throws at us. I know that I can trust mine to get me from point A to B in the ice and snow or rain and slush without damaging my shoes or my outfit. When it comes to the fur and material of the Mukluks, they are made waterproof to withstand the rain and snow, but you still want to use a protector on these, particularly to keep the fabric and fur in their best condition year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blundstones</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want something a little more versatile that is great right through from spring to fall, Blundstones and similarly styled shoes are a great option for not only the water and slush, but they are light enough to keep wearing throughout the summer, and it&#8217;s a bonus that they look great with almost anything. These are fashionable leather ankle boots that are not only trending but versatile. These are a great style when you have to wear them inside and out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7756\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-jill-wellington-34519.png 1530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rubber Boots</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubber boots are a cute classic option when you can&#8217;t get out of staying in and safe from the rain. Make it dry from door to door dry through puddles and slush. You can&#8217;t go wrong with a pair of rubber boots in your rainy-day wardrobe. With thousands of cute cuts, styles, and accessories to go with them, you are going to end up wanting to wear your rubber boots this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rubber Boot Liners</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to compromise style for functionality on days when you have to wear your rubber boots. Rubber boot liners are a fashionable addition that goes with any style. Most brands and companies like Hunter have helped make wearing rubber boots from drab to fab. Not only do they add an extra soft liner for your boot, so you don&#8217;t have to walk on rubber, but they look great too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Woman wearing hat and jacket\" class=\"wp-image-7758\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-790357.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cute Classic Coats</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every spring wardrobe needs a classic coat to complete it.

It goes without saying that everyone should have an umbrella on standby in their closet or bag, just in case of unexpected rainfall or drive-by splashes. Anyone who has waited at a bus stop knows exactly what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pocket Poncho</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Be prepared for unexpected rainfall with a pocket poncho. These are great to keep in your bag or your car just in case you are caught in the rain, without a jacket or umbrella. They have come a long way from the plastic bag look they used to come in. You can find many fashionable options that you will actually want to wear that you&#8217;ll be glad you have on you when you do have to wear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is one of the most fashionable times of the year, but it can be hard to stay that way when it is almost one of the messiest times of the year. But with these great pieces in your wardrobe, you will be ready for anything without having to compromise on style.

What better way is there to ring in the holiday than with your best and brightest around a table for a couple of sips and a few bites to eat, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your date set, the guest list firm, and the invitations sent, it’s time to narrow in on the details of this party. These holiday themes are packaged and paired nicely with your food, decoration, and activity options. While Christmas is a theme of its own, changing things up will help to keep things fresh and make your party stand out. I am offering this list of party ideas to help you ramp up your holiday season as you get ready to wind down the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7268\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RWG Christmas</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, Christmas is its own theme and allows you to keep it easy by grabbing all the green, gold, white, and red you can from any of your local shops. Seven-foot self-lighting tree? Check. Popcorn tinsel? Done. An RWG Christmas (red, white, and green) gives you the chance to slide into the holiday season easily with pre-packaged décor and maybe a pine branch or two from your local coniferous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Try making your space look more festive with some traditional Christmas garnishes. Hang a stocking by the fire (or TV stand), throw up some mistletoe (for that special someone who walks through the door), and grab a couple of empty boxes to wrap and place beneath your tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: You can’t do traditional Christmas without a Christmas ham or turkey. For those looking for a vegetarian option, why not try a nut loaf as a savory alternative. For those who want to keep it simple, try one of the holiday feature meal kits from local restaurants like <a href=\"https://localpubliceatery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Local Public Eatery</a>. Pair your dinner with your favorite sides like mash potatoes, some greens, and a dinner roll (or two). Pick up a bottle of wine from <a href=\"https://www.ellementwine.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ellement</a> at the Forks. Wrap this meal up with some holiday sweets from local bakeries like <a href=\"https://tallgrassbakery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tall Grass Prairie</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xn--gtowpg-wta.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gato Bakeshop</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep friends and family entertained with an ugly sweater contest or a gingerbread house-building competition. You might just want to crack out a board game and play until the night runs dry. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7269\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tinsel and Tini</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to zhuzh things up this holiday season? Test out a Tinsel and Tini party that will give you a chance to crack out the sparkles and get a bit fancy. Think New Years&#8217; Eve at Christmas!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: While a classic pine is usually a go-to, an all-white tree will allow your Tinsel and Tinis party to shine. Dress it up with some silver and white decorations that shimmer like the snow on a sunny day. Pair this with a tinsel garland held together with a few logs of white birch and a couple of soy candles from <a href=\"https://www.coalandcanary.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Coal and Canary</a>. Tip: add in some hints of gold and pine green to tie this look together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: A Tinsel and Tini party is all about the Martinis. Test out your bartending skills with a few different options like this <a href=\"https://inspiredbycharm.com/white-christmas-martini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White Martini</a> from Inspired Charm or these <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/g2881/christmas-martinis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">holiday-inspired mixes</a> posted by Town &amp; Country. As for what to eat? Do dinner differently with a choose-your-own-adventure tapas bar. &nbsp;Keep it Christmas by throwing in some slices of turkey, a few dinner rolls, and some green and red olives. Top off the platter with some white chocolate bark or macaroons from <a href=\"https://www.caroonbymj.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caroon by MJ</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep this party focussed on the sips and dips by hosting a DIY martini bar! Throw in fondue and keep your guest full of laughs from mishaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7270\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nutcracker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s annual show, this theme allows you to tap into your artistic side and get busy with some DIY. Think sugar plum fairies, kingdoms and crowns, and a magic wand to bring it all to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: As with most of these themes, it starts with a tree, and this time, the bigger, the better. Dress your majestic coniferous in gold and wrap the base in crimson. Flank this tree with a couple of nutcracker soldiers, throw on some candy canes and add an angel on top. Hang those stockings and use a bit of extra fabric to create a luxurious garland for your “fireplace”. The key to this Christmas theme is decadence and extravagance. Make this party feel authentic by picking up a few antiques from <a href=\"https://www.thingsforrwb.com/?fbclid=IwAR0S4bGw8NmQXGkstmSPZXXLDCqKBrsirUodsSPo1lgxDmtvcWvomNqOR28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Things by RWB</a>. Remember to watch out for that Rat King though, he might try to steal all your goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Get into the theme by trying a few meat pies from local vendor <a href=\"http://www.mollysmeatpies.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Molly’s Meat Pies</a>. Pair these with some mushroom soup (my favorite is from <a href=\"https://earls.ca/locations/main-street/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Earl’s on Main Street</a>!) and a side of green beans. Grab a sip of your favorite vodka and try your hand at some homemade marzipan or sugar plums. Or you could just eat the candy canes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: What better way to get into character than by hosting a dress-up party? Have people come in their best nutcracker-inspired couture and dance the night away. You could even throw in a crown-making activity to see who really will be crowned the next Rat King!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7272\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>True North</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for something a bit more low-key? Why not think about an all-Canadian Christmas theme that screams cozy and cute with a little bit of camp? That’s right, we are talking about plaid wrapped in twine and drizzled in snowflakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Get that tree up and dress it in plaid and gold ribbons and bows. Feel free to paint the tips with a bit of white to make it look like it has just snowed. Those plaid stockings with the buck cut-out hung together with a few strings of twine would make a fine addition. If you want to get into the spirit, why not up the ante with a couple of hand-carved pieces from the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/qaumajuq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Winnipeg Art Gallery</a> in support of the new Qaumajuq gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Is it too much of a cliché to call on poutine, Bannock, and bacon, and beers? I don’t think so. Stay cozy and homey by serving up these Canadian favorites with a side of split pea soup. To end the evening, fire up the kettle and serve a round of hot toddies (maple syrup required) with a couple of butter tarts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Who can say no to a poutine station? Head down to the <a href=\"https://thecheesemongers.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cheesemongers Fromagerie</a> on Corydon and pick up some of your favorite poutine toppings. End this evening with a gift exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you choose to do, have a very happy holiday with your nearest and dearest!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can smell it in the air – the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season.

For instance, one of Winnipeg’s most popular thrift stores, <a href=\"https://www.valuevillage.com/\">Value Village</a>, donates a large portion of their proceeds back into the community.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personal impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>My favorite item in my downtown apartment is a unique, red oak coffee table that I copped from <a href=\"http://canadiangoodwill.ca/\">Goodwill</a> for just $12! Amazed by my deal, I looked online—similar items sold for $150. Need I say more?</p>\n<h3>How to Shop Secondhand Décor</h3>\n<p>Friendly reminder that when you buy used, you’re technically sharing with the previous owners. Check fabric and upholstered pieces carefully before making your purchase. Always check for M.O.P.S: mildew, odors, pests and stains!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shop prepared</strong></em></p>\n<p>Knowing the measurements of the room you want to decorate is key! There’s nothing worse than coming home with your dream rug only to realize it’s way too big for your space. Measure the room beforehand, write the measurements down, and bring a measuring tape with you when you go shopping. These simple precautions will save you so much hassle.</p>\n<p>Focus on key pieces first, rather than browsing everything. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when thrifting. You might be on a mission for a coffee table but end up lost among dozens of decorative mirrors.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Look for potential, not perfection</strong></em></p>\n<p>Thrifted goods likely won’t look perfect when you purchase them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t right for your space.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5990\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Know your style</strong></em></p>\n<p>Combining a variety of decorating styles can be a cool, edgy look, but only when done carefully. Avoid decorating seasickness by carefully considering two questions: What’s your existing style, and what colour scheme are you going for?</p>\n<p>You’re decorating a space that you’ll be spending a lot of time in. Make sure you like the items you bring into your space and that they reflect your personal style. You’re doing no one any good by decorating the space in fads and trends that you really don’t truly like. And having an assortment of colours and furniture can be a pretty, eccentric look, but there should always be an overall colour scheme to keep your room cohesive.</p>\n<h3>What to Buy New</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Mattress</strong></em></p>\n<p>When it comes to mattress shopping, I have two words for you: bed bugs! A mattress is one of the most important things to buy after signing the lease to your new apartment. I think it goes without saying that buying a used mattress is a no-no. Bed bugs are great hitchhikers!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Crib</strong></em></p>\n<p>Having a baby is expensive, but a crib is not something you should want to skimp on. Buying a used crib is risky, because you don’t know what type of internal damage there might be.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pet furniture</strong></em></p>\n<p>You have no way of knowing what previous pets were up to on second-hand pet beds, crates, blankets or toys. To ensure your furry friend has a clean and safe place to sit or sleep, avoid buying pet items second-hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer thrifting or buying new for your apartment?

Even if it’s not your favourite thing, choose furniture carefully to ensure you have a happy, comfortable abode. There is no one style that will suit everyone, so let’s look at some things you should consider before you furnish your digs.</p>\n<h3>The Living Room</h3>\n<p>We’ll start in the living room or family room. You’ve got options when it comes to your furniture upholstery, such as leather, wood or fabric. What will work best for you depends on a few factors.</p>\n<p>Nice furnishings don’t always mix well with children or clawed pets. If you have small children or a feline who loves to scratch, you might want to save yourself some heartache and avoid expensive materials like leather.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5964\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-770x577.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should also consider the temperature you tend to keep your home at. If you like thing on the warm side, be aware that leather can stick to bare skin. There’s nothing fun about the sting that follows peeling your body off leather furniture. On the other hand, leather is durable and comfy to sink into. For the vegans or vegetarians among you, leather is likely out, so you may want to consider <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vimle-sofa-with-chaise-farsta-dark-brown-s79206994/\">artificial leather</a> or a different type of upholstery.</p>\n<p>Wood can be nice for some furnishings, but you don’t want an entire couch made of it. (Imagine trying to take an afternoon nap on that.) Wood can stand up to Fluffy and her talons, though, so you might look for couches and chairs that pair wood frames with fabric coverings if you have a particularly-destructive cat. Wood gives a room a nice look and has great durability. I have cube-shaped, solid-wood end tables that I can stand on. They’re great for when my short frame needs to dust high places. Places like <a href=\"https://www.biglowwoodcraft.com/\">Biglow Woodcraft</a> make beautiful pieces right here in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5961\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"681\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-770x1157.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-500x751.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-1400x2104.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" /></p>\n<p>Cost is another factor when we decide what to buy. Leather and wood tend to be more expensive than fabric, so they might end up out of your price range. When considering cost, think about how long you intend to have that piece of furniture. Some people want to buy something and use it forever, and others like to change up their décor regularly. You may want to spend a bit less if you can’t see yourself liking the same desk or chair for years; you’ll want to replace it eventually.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5966\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>The size of your space also plays a major role in your furniture shopping. You might love the idea of a gigantic sectional so all your friends can come over and watch Jets games, but a sectional won’t work in a tiny apartment. Instead, you might choose something like this <a href=\"https://www.thesefourwalls.ca/sofas-sectionals/axis-sofa\">plush-looking condo sofa</a>. My home is small, so we’ve gotten good at picking up furniture that fits in our space. Some people look at Ikea with disdain, but it’s a great place to find <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/rooms_ideas/small_spaces/index.html\">pieces designed for small spaces</a>. We wanted a futon for our spare bedroom/office, but the room doesn’t have space for a double-sized futon. Ikea came to our rescue with a <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vallentuna-sleeper-module-with-backrests-hillared-light-blue-s49277488/\">chair futon</a> that folds out into a single bed. It’s also super comfy!</p>\n<p>You can look for other furniture that does double duty. We store cooking magazines inside an <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/product/fay-storage-ottoman--alexa-steel-212122.html?cgid=LIVING-SEATING-OTTOMANSBENCHES#sz=12&amp;start=21\">ottoman that opens up to double as storage</a>. Floating shelves look good and provide storage for books and knick-knacks.</p>\n<h3>The Dining Experience</h3>\n<p>Does your dining room table simply act as a repository for your mail and random objects? Or do you fancy yourself a chef and do a lot of entertaining? If you’re more the chef type, choose your table wisely. Will you have enough room for your friends and family to gather around?</p>\n<p>Look for a table that extends if you sometimes need to serve a larger group. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.designmanitoba.com/store/p2052/Nexus_Extendable_table_by_Amisco.html\">extendable tables</a> are not all equal. How easy is it to extend/collapse? Do you have to store the extra leaf somewhere else? We bought a great table from <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/home/\">Urban Barn</a> a few years ago. It extends so we can host a crowd, and one person can set up the extension without help. The extra leaf butterflies and folds down under the table, so we don’t have to store it anywhere else in our already-tight space. It’s a far cry from the tables of old that needed (at least) two people and an engineering degree to add or remove a huge leaf, which took up valuable storage space when not in use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5968\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Pay attention to your <a href=\"https://www.thebrick.com/collections/furniture-dining-room-chairs\">dining chairs</a>, too. Do people often linger at your table? If so, choose chairs that can be comfortable for a few hours. When we bought our table, we had the option of purchasing coordinating benches that would have seated 3 people each. They were beautiful, solid wood benches—and horribly uncomfortable. We found wood-framed chairs with leather upholstery instead, so our guests don’t need to visit the chiropractor after dining with us.</p>\n<p>Chairs also allow you to show off your personal style. You can choose chairs all in the same subdued hue or add a bit of flair and a pop of colour! We had 4 different colour options when we bought our dining chairs and couldn’t decide which we liked better. So we bought 2 of each colour! Our <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\">mismatched chairs</a> add a bit of whimsy to our slate grey table.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px; border: #eee 1px solid;\" src=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Technology Can Help You Decide</h3>\n<p>When looking for furniture, you can download a room design app to help you decide what you want! It’s fun to virtually plan out a room to see what it might look like and what will fit. With the right app, you can do more than use your imagination when you are trying to decide what works and doesn’t. Here’s an article that links to some <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-7-best-apps-for-room-design-amp-room-layout-244213\">popular room design apps you can try</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d still recommend going to showrooms, since look and size are only part of the picture when it comes to choosing furniture. I’m always most concerned with comfort and practicality in my furniture, but you can choose to go entirely online for your furniture buying. Either way, take the time to do your research and think about what you truly need. Buying furniture is far more expensive than buying clothes and you’ll be living with your decisions for a long time. Don’t get stuck with buyer’s remorse when it comes to your furniture!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Where is your favourite place to shop for furniture in Winnipeg?

It was the first time I didn’t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn’t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.</p>\n<p>But while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it’s pretty small—at around 500 square feet—and narrow enough that I can’t fit furniture on both sides of the living/dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn’t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.</p>\n<p>I’m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/anxiety-zen/201612/minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health\">feel</a> unburdened in the place that should matter most—home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.</p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>When you have less space to leave things lying around, you can’t afford to have much clutter! Even if you’re not a messy person, it’s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It’s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn’t really want, impulse buys you could’ve done without, and clothing and shoes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don’t want to be looking at your things, especially if it’s miscellaneous stuff you’re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!</p>\n<p>Before you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don’t want or need (<a href=\"https://www.siloam.ca/donate/donate/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE\">Siloam Mission</a> gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you’ll have more room to work with.</p>\n<p>For storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.</p>\n<p>Under the bed is a great place to store items you don’t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.</p>\n<p>If your building has storage lockers, use yours! They’re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.</p>\n<h3>Furniture</h3>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://hutk.ca/\">choosing furniture</a> for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don’t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don’t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.</p>\n<p>Go for <a href=\"http://www.interiorillusions.ca/product-category/furniture/living-room/accent-chairs/\">sleek armless chairs</a>, and try transparent coffee tables, which won’t look like they’re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3430\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3430\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"940\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3430\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by @interior_illusions on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Dual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you’re not using them.</p>\n<p>Look into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you’re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you’re hosting brunch.</p>\n<p>For storing things like books and <a href=\"http://intothemusic.ca/\">records</a>, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You’ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They’re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.</p>\n<p>A TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector—they’re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.</p>\n<h3>Decoration</h3>\n<p>Plants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they’re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered. Stop by <a href=\"http://verdeplantdesign.com/\">Verde Plant Design</a> for a great selection!</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to decorate your walls with <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/visit/shop\">art</a> that you love. Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.</p>\n<p>Hang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame—it’ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.</p>\n<p>When it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>Where do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can’t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don’t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Any tips for decorating a small space?

But as the gentrification of downtown Winnipeg and the Exchange District gains momentum, more and more small businesses are popping up. Quaintly nestled within the large historic buildings of the downtown area, some of these shops are easy to miss if you don’t know where to look. Those with an eye for fashion might want to keep an eye out for these hidden fashion boutiques downtown and in the Exchange District.</p>\n<h3>Lennard Taylor</h3>\n<p>246 McDermot Avenue<br />\nSince 2015</p>\n<p>This clothing store bears the name of its young designer. A boutique fashion house that designs and produces its own high-quality clothing for women, there is even opportunity at the back of the store for interested shoppers to watch how the clothing is produced. The style is both classic and modern at the same time; comfortable business wear or elevated casual wear. Lennard Taylor invites custom work and offers pieces of original art for sale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lennardtaylor.com/\">www.lennardtaylor.com</a></p>\n<h3>Flaunt Boutique</h3>\n<p>106-270 Waterfront Drive<br />\nSince 2014</p>\n<p>This store is located on the first floor of one of the condo buildings on Waterfront Drive and is a worthwhile destination for those who value a unique fashion find. Flaunt Boutique is a new business venture for De Luca’s co-owner Kate Holden, showcasing clothing, shoes, handbags, and accessories for women. Every piece of merchandise is exclusive to their shop; these products are not available at any other location in</p>\n<p>Winnipeg. It’s a compelling stop for evening and party wear, or to reinvent your look with a unique accessory or piece of jewellery.</p>\n<p>www.shopflaunt.ca</p>\n<h3>Livestock Winnipeg</h3>\n<p>407 Graham Avenue<br />\nSince 2017</p>\n<p>On my first attempt to check out this shop, I completely missed it and kept walking. That’s a tribute to how hidden it is. This store is located at 407 Graham Avenue and is the thirds of its chain to open in Canada, following a store in Vancouver and another in Toronto. Livestock specializes in sneakers and modern streetwear. It’s unquestionably a top stop for the sneakerhead, or for anyone on a serious hunt for a pair of fashionable sneakers. Livestock Winnipeg carries men’s/unisex clothing in-store and a smaller selection of women’s clothing online.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deadstock.ca/\">www.deadstock.ca</a></p>\n<h3>Boutique Anya</h3>\n<p>88 Albert St.<br />\nSince 2015</p>\n<p>This little shop is locally owned and operated by designer Alicja Dalecki. It carries a curated collection of contemporary women’s clothing, housewares, statement jewelry, and environmentally-aware cosmetics. Created by both local and international designers, Boutique Anya’s products favour a minimalist design crafted from natural materials. You’ll find something unique, natural and beautiful here&#8230;and off the beaten track</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.boutiqueanya.com/\">www.boutiqueanya.com</a></p>\n<p>So forget the congestion of the mall and the monotony of shopping at another box store. Grab your fancy coffee downtown and make an afternoon of checking out these hidden gem boutiques with a friend. The chances are good it will be worth your while.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winnipeggers know the best boutique shopping is on Academy Road or in Osborne Village.
