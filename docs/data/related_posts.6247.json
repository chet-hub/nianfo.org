There are also the </span><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.ca/product/levolor-decorative-roller-shades/1000113182\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">pull-down roller types</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> or roman blinds if you want to use </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">that fabric you have your eye on, but you might need to get them custom made.</span></p>\n<h3>2. How much work are you willing to put into installing them?</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Blinds contain mechanisms for opening and closing, making them immediately more com</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">plicated. Keep in mind that you’re either going to be mounting them to the inside of the window frame or the wall itself! This means </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">you’ll </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">need to drill directly into something, and be precise with your measurements </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">for </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">inset blinds.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you’re co</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ncerned about damaging the walls, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">heavy-duty </span><a href=\"https://www.walmart.ca/en/command/N-1020336\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Command hooks</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> are usually capable of supporting a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">curtain rod </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">(as long as you’re not hanging those weighty antique velvet drapes). Plus, you’re </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">dealing with just the one rod, so it’s not as complex.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here’s a</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">neat trick I came across</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">: W</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">hen you’re marking the spots for the support mounts, if you position an L-shaped piece of cardboard against the window frame and push a pencil through, you can flip it around to mark the opposite mounting point evenly. (So simpl</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">e, yet so genius. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Thanks, Youtube!)</span></p>\n<h3>3. How frequently are you going to clean them?</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now this one, you need to </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">be</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> honest about. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Nobody stays on top of their cleaning as much as they’d like to. (Or maybe you do. Don’t judge me!)  Really though, how often will</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">actually</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> bother looking at how dusty your blinds are?</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you want to keep blinds clean, you need to wipe them down once a week or so. If that sounds like something you can handle, go for it. Curtains can usually</span><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">*</span></i></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> just go in the washer every few month</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">s, depending on what they’re made of.</span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">*</span></i><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Please guys, for the sake of textile integrity, if your curtains come with washing instructions</span></i><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> – read </span></i><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">them and do what they say!</span></i></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now what about everyday quality of life stuff?

Or do you work nights</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, with a</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sleep cycle </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">that </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">demands </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">you block out every </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">vile </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ray of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">sunlight?</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Curtains are g</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">enerally better for </span><a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/majgull-blackout-curtains-1-pair-dark-blue-70341034/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">blocking out more light</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

And unless you’ve got something like a fancy electric track rigged up, you have to physically open and close them.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you ain’t got time</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for that, blinds have a string you can pull, or a knob you can twist to do the job for you more quickly. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Maximum efficiency!</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Plus! With slatted blinds you can adjust how much or how little light to let in. Not to </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">throw shade</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> at</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> curtains</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> but this i</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">s the feature I find the most </span><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">val</span></i></b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">-ance-</span></i><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">uable</span></i></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (okay, no more puns).
