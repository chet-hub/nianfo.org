Decorating for the holidays in a small space can be tricky, so we’re here to help with a collection of festive ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Christmas Tree Chaos</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Miniature Tree</strong><br />\nIt may be small, but a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/s?bbn=6647219011&amp;rh=n%3A2206275011%2Cn%3A%212206276011%2Cn%3A2224027011%2Cn%3A2224031011%2Cn%3A13848649011%2Cn%3A6647219011%2Cp_n_size_browse-bin%3A6819137011&amp;dc&amp;fst=as%3Aoff&amp;qid=1574642410&amp;rnid=6819135011&amp;ref=lp_6647219011_nr_p_n_size_browse-bin_1\">miniature Christmas tree</a> can still pack a stylish punch. A tiny tree is one of the easiest and most common decorations for small spaces. I decorate my miniature tree with an over-the-top tree topper, festive ornaments, and twinkling fairy lights. I also like to sweeten it up with a few candy canes. Even though it’s tiny, I love how my Christmas tree lights up the room with its larger-than-life presence.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6093\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Half of a Christmas Tree<br />\n</strong>I admit this one requires an open mind. When I first heard about half Christmas trees, I thought whoever came up with the idea was insane. But, after a few sleepless nights up thinking about it (it <em>really</em> bothered me), I realized its brilliance!</p>\n<p>Tuck this slim, festive fellow in a corner for all the fun of a full-size Christmas tree for half the space. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/TANGKULA-Artificial-Christmas-Half-Shape-Decoration/dp/B081MYBNG7/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=half+christmas+tree&amp;qid=1574640178&amp;sr=8-16\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/Home-Heritage-7-Ft-Pre-Lit-Artificial-Half-Christmas-Tree-with-Folding-Stand/PRD1TCPD0VT30L5\">Walmart</a> sell cheap but high-quality half Christmas trees.</p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Tree Doesn’t Need to be Pine<br />\n</strong>When you imagine a Christmas tree, you’re automatically going to picture a lush, green pine tree. But I’m here to advocate for all the other types of plant that can be just as festive!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6090\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-671x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"671\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-671x1024.jpg 671w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-197x300.jpg 197w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-770x1176.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-500x763.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-293x447.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-1400x2137.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917.jpg 2045w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for more greenery or just don’t want to go out and buy a tree, consider giving one of your houseplants a chance to shine this holiday season. I like to decorate the <a href=\"https://www.shelmerdine.com/product/fiddle-leaf-fig-tree/\">fiddle leaf fig tree</a> in my bedroom with bulbs, holly and candy canes. It’s quirky and brings so much character to the room.</p>\n<p><strong>Festive Fairy Light Tree<br />\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Kohree-Changing-Decorative-Stroller-DecorTree/dp/B01HO0RVCI/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=fairy+lights&amp;qid=1574642608&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-7\">Fairy lights</a> have so many uses; you can string them up or get creative! When I was first settling into my downtown apartment and wasn’t sure if I wanted to invest in a tree, I created one myself. Pair your fairy lights with garland and pin them up on your wall in the shape of a pine tree (or a fiddle leaf fig tree!), and you’ve got yourself a DIY Christmas tree. Be creative: you can attach bulbs or even candy canes to it, just like a real tree.</p>\n<p>This trick can also be used as a decoration hack for those who celebrate other holidays. Creating a Star of David with the lights on your wall is just as simple and beautiful!</p>\n<h3>Mantel Makeover</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty lucky; my apartment has a brick fireplace with a beautiful oak mantel. If you have a fireplace, decorating the mantel is an easy way to display small decorations without taking up floor space.</p>\n<p>Since I like to keep the rest of my living room fairly simple for Holiday decorating, I make the mantle my centerpiece. I prefer traditional Christmas colours, so I decorate my mantel with deep greens by pinning a flocked pine wreath above the fireplace and draping garland across the mantle. I then strategically place crimson-red holly within the garland and finish the look by pinning up a few red stockings. The stockings also draw my guests’ eyes down to the burning fire underneath, completing the cozy look I’m going for.</p>\n<p><strong>Utilizing Holiday Cards</strong><br />\nI don’t know about you, but as soon as December 1st hits I’m bombarded with <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/search?q=christmas+card&amp;locationQuery=6183235\">holiday cards</a> from family, friends and co-workers. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but at first I was confused about what to do with all of them. Eventually, inspiration struck and I started selecting a few with the most festive illustrations to display on my mantel behind my garland. Not only do they make cheerful decorations, they also remind me of my loved ones.</p>\n<h3>Deck the Halls—Literally!</h3>\n<p><strong>Mistletoe<br />\n</strong>Mistletoe is a winter classic that doesn’t take up any space at all. All you need is a doorway, such as in a hallway, to let the festive smooches begin!</p>\n<p><strong>Paper Snowflakes</strong><br />\nI love decorating my space with <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-6-Pointed-Paper-Snowflakes/\">paper snowflakes</a>. They make me feel so nostalgic about being a kid and spending all winter snipping them out with safety scissors. As an adult, they’re an inexpensive decoration that brings the romance of snow into your home – without the chill.</p>\n<p>I personally like stringing paper snowflakes up on the ceiling, letting them drape down to bring a touch of magic to an entranceway. Try hanging them by a window where they can catch the every-changing winter light.</p>\n<h3>Create a Holiday Scent</h3>\n<p>So, your place looks festive…but does it smell festive? <a href=\"https://www.charlestonandharlow.com/collections/fall-holiday\">Scented candles</a> are the easiest way to bring a merry aroma to your apartment. Cinnamon, gingerbread, fire and pine are a few of my favourite scented candle fragrances; all these are super easy to find in your favourite candle shop! Coal and Canary even sells a cute <a href=\"https://www.coalandcanary.com/product-page/holiday-collection-box-set\">Holiday Collection Box Set</a>.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5RGZdpBM9-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;
