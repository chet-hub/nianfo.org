Covering over 2000 square kilometers, this section of the province is about 2 hours from Winnipeg, close to the Manitoba &#8211; Ontario border. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10189\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has many popular spots and different options for camping. From cabins to private tent pitching, there is an experience for every kind of camper, from the camper to the glamper. Some of the best campsites in the Whiteshell area are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Westhawk Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Westhawk lake is famous for its unique origin story. The lake was the result of a meteorite crash at this location long ago, which ended up giving Manitoba its deepest lake at 115 km. Westhawk lake is a great spot to camp. It has many campsites close to the lake with water, electricity, and nearby shops and food; Westhawk is a very comfortable camping experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10190\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason why Westhawk is so popular is it is attached to its neighbor, Caddy Lake, but you will have to go through some pretty captivating tunnels to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Caddy Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Caddy Lake is a beautiful place to go camping, especially for the active camper, as it is connected to Westhawk Lake by a series of tunnels. You might need a kayak, canoe, or boat to get to and around the lake and campgrounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10191\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are planning on camping or visiting Caddy Lake, it is well worth the trip. Once you are there, you have the choice of some nice, more secluded campsites near the lake or within hiking distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Falcon Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Falcon Lake is another long-time Manitoba favorite when it comes to camping. Also, within the Whiteshell provincial park and less than a 2-hour drive from Winnipeg, Falcon Lake is one of the most popular campgrounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10192\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring RV and tent campsites complete with electricity, water, showers, playgrounds, and most of which are within walking distance to the beach.
