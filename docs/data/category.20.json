What we decide to call <em>lasting</em> and <em>classic</em> depends on our ideas of current and vintage trends. It comes from our backgrounds, preferences, and our feelings.</p>\n<p>I might call my yellow sofa timeless, but it might not be something you want to see in your living room every day for the next twenty years. I know why the tweed Chanel suit is considered beautiful and timeless, but it’s just not for me. When it comes to home décor, the same rules apply; each piece of furniture should suit your vision and your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The point of such a talky introduction was only to get us thinking about and appreciating the things we own. In a fast-paced world full of issues such as climate change, plastic and fast-fashion production, we ought to pay attention to the quality and durability of our clothes and furniture. Building a wardrobe and home centered on timeless pieces will make a positive difference to both your life and the environment. Let’s look at the process of searching for décor that will last.</p>\n<h3>1. Stay away from clichés</h3>\n<p>A home that evokes sighs of admiration with its timeless style wasn&#8217;t decorated in a week. Everything that deserves attention, anything that will last, takes time, love and effort to find. I’m not trying to judge Costco or IKEA. However, I tend to believe in other, more sophisticated and exciting ways of discovering your home essentials.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6038\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, ikea\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Current trends, which tell us to live more organically and embrace slow-fashion and slow-living, affect our ideas about the right way to shop. There are many ways to avoid mass-produced pieces of furniture to find something that will add character to your place that you’ll treasure and enjoy using.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit flea markets and antique stores, like <a href=\"http://antiquesandfunk.com/\">Antiques &amp; Funk</a> or the <a href=\"https://thejohnstonterminal.com/\">Johnston Terminal Antique Mall</a>. Honestly, what compares to the thrill of finding a chair in Louis XIV style, or a set of old chandeliers to make each dinner and party you host sparkle?<a href=\"https://thejohnstonterminal.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6040 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, johnston terminal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-770x433.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-500x281.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-293x165.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></li>\n<li>Try local furniture boutiques. When people hear the word “boutique,” they tend to imagine high-end pieces with high-end prices. But you’d be surprised by the quality you can find at affordable prices My yellow couch, for example, cost just under $600, and the quality and the style are tremendous!</li>\n<li>Frequent local marketplaces that feature artists and makers. These markets, like <a href=\"https://alleywaysmarket.ca/\">Alleyways Market</a> or <a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\">Third + Bird</a>, can be found throughout the year in Winnipeg. Many artists will have examples at their booths that can be pre-ordered or purchased on the spot. I’ve found beautiful wooden side tables, kitchen items made from olive wood, and handmade woven baskets that are great for décor and storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg\" alt=\"third + bird\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg 800w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-300x150.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-770x385.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-500x250.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-585x293.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-293x147.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go treasure hunting at thrift stores and second-hand places. Sure, sometimes you’ll leave empty-handed, but you might also leave with pieces that will suit your style and serve you loyally. Search thrift stores for small details like a magazine stand, books, candelabras or even seasonal decorations. You’ll find unique pieces while doing your part for the environment by reusing, recycling, and restyling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Add culture to your place</h3>\n<p>My great-grandmother was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruska_Roma\">Ruska Roma</a>. Learning this explained a lot about my preferences. Every time I promised myself that I would keep my house minimalistic, and style it simply with bohemian pieces, I would find something a colourful carpet, golden candle holder, or velvet pillow I couldn’t resist.</p>\n<p>Don’t let a fear of being different blind you. Don’t force yourself to follow trends and clichés if you feel no connection to it. I’m not saying to surround yourself with only appropriate cultural pieces. You don’t want your home to be a museum; you want it to be your home that reflects who you are and feels comfortable and warm. Add culture by mixing in art pieces (maybe something you picked up while travelling) with modern furniture for a timeless look.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6045\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, bohemian\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Imagine a room where the main pieces, like the sofa, chairs, and table, are simple, but the room feels full of character. Look closer, and you will notice more than basic furniture. Is that a rug from India? Are there French impressionist paintings? Photographs? Are there handmade vases from Poland? Discover what your culture is about and sprinkle it throughout your home.</p>\n<h3>3. Let the basics be timeless</h3>\n<p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: everyone has their own interpretation of what makes something timeless. However, there are some standard rules for choosing timeless pieces.</p>\n<p>Allow bigger pieces such as sofas, dining tables, kitchen cabinets, and your bed to be timeless. The same rules that apply in fashion apply to interior design: keep your essential wardrobe and basic furniture functional and timeless. Then, add trendy or cultural notes to it seasonally.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6046\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Timeless furniture makes a functional base but doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. Research the epoch you find the most delightful or interesting and be inspired by its designs. Pay attention to descriptions such as “retro”, “mid-century” and “contemporary”; you might even keep an eye out for “Victorian” if you like a bit of pomp. Use these pieces fearlessly as your basics.</p>\n<p>If cultural or trendy decorative details suit your personality, then timeless furniture is your neutral base. The more timeless and essential your main furniture is, the longer it will stay with you. You merely won&#8217;t get tired of its appearance and presence.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>The advice that helped me: start a mood board (physical or just on Pinterest) and do your research. Collect ideas for timeless (but not dull and boring!) interior design pieces. Then, enjoy the slow thrill of the furniture hunt at antique stores, little unknown shops. Search Instagram for artists and handcrafters; you might find unique dish sets, side tables, pillows and baskets. When you’re finished, your home will be more than just a shelter. It will be full of useful, uncommon pieces that have a story behind them; pieces that serve you and express your individuality. And that’s truly timeless.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What are your favourite places for finding unique, lasting pieces of furniture?

Interior design trends tend to parallel fashion. The beautiful difference between modern fashion and the styles of the 20s and 70s (years that <a href=\"https://www.chanel.com/en_CA/\"><em>Chanel</em></a> marked the most in fashion history) is that now we mix different styles that seem to have nothing in common. Being able to adapt old, mix it with new, and add elements that reflect your true self is living fashionably.</p>\n<p>When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing. If someone tries to guess why everything around your house looks so special—let them guess. The secret is as simple as Scandinavian minimalist: mix it all. Here are 5 things you need to know to get started.</p>\n<h3>1. Do your research</h3>\n<p>Perhaps you’re at the threshold, about to refurnish your apartment or just moved into a new place. Either way, the question running through your mind is the same: “How do I make my home nicer, fashionable or just refreshing?”</p>\n<p>At this stage, you might already have an idea of how you want your place to look. But in the worst-case scenario, you can’t even imagine; just picking a color for your new couch sounds about as fun as a polar bear dip. Either way, a little research will get your home makeover off to the right start!</p>\n<p>If you already know what you crave, research will give you fresh ideas and inspiration. It will open up new horizons, help you make decisions, and narrow down your preferences to one or two major styles.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example: we all like different things. Ask my husband and I what we think about mid-century nightstands, and you’ll hear a lot of arguments. Mid-century nightstands are the only thing we couldn’t agree on when furnishing our bedroom. In situations like this, doing a bit of research can uncover new ideas, compromises, and inspiration.</p>\n<p>I suggest <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.ca/\">Pinterest</a> (of course!), interior design books—for a general feel—and movies. Inspiration can come from anywhere! We’re all drawn to certain items and materials that reflect our interests, preferences, and dreams. The key to décor that you love is to listen to that voice inside you that reacts immediately during the research phase.</p>\n<h3>2. Modern design</h3>\n<p>Modern design is hard to define exactly. It reflects modern art and features the best of minimalism, sophistication, and elegance. Modern interior design is also known for its focus on practicality and usefulness. Every piece in a modern apartment should be useful, rather than artsy and architectural.</p>\n<p>Simple lines. Neutral tones. Earthy colors. Open space. That’s the core of modern interior design. This aesthetic has its roots in Scandinavian and German architecture and features more colourful accents than true minimalism does (we’ll get to that later).</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4686\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4686\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4686\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Design, Living Room, Home Decor, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Luxury Apartment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/indoor-4148894_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4686\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From tianya1223 on Pixabay</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The open areas, minimalistic and airy aesthetic in modern design has one big disadvantage: It can feel like an office. If you decide to go for a modern look, avoid the strictness and simplicity that is inherent to office space. Focus on details to keep your apartment feeling warm and comfortable. Sentimental photographs of your cat, colourful paintings, wool-textured blankets on the couch, and a few vintage candle holders keep a modern simple space looking cozy and welcoming.</p>\n<h3>3. Vintage interior design</h3>\n<p>Romantic, elegant and as cozy as grandma’s house: that’s vintage interior design. Vintage décor creates a feeling of nostalgia through old-fashioned style furniture and lots of texture in pillows, blankets, vases, and paintings. Details like scratches and scrapes on furniture are essential! I suggest visiting your grandparents and asking for that old, scratched-up dresser to make it a statement piece in your bedroom.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4688\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4688\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4688\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-237x300.jpg 237w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-770x975.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-809x1024.jpg 809w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-500x633.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-293x371.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-479121-unsplash-1400x1773.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4688\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4689\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4689\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4689\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Design, Vintage Dresser, Vintage Style, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Furniture, Winnipeg Apartments, Accent Dresser\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/stephanie-harvey-435461-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From Stephanie Harvey of Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>As cozy as vintage can be, it’s important to achieve balance between old and new. It would be easy to go to a flea market and buy a set of furniture, floral wallpaper, a record player, and call it a day; the danger is that your space might end up looking bulky and copied. It might look and feel like living in an old movie. This is where balance comes in: Use antiques and vintage finds as accents.</p>\n<p>Beside a modern grey couch, place an antique blush pink sofa chair. Instead of floral wallpaper, paint your walls grey or white and hang vintage photographs or oil paintings. Definitely show off your record player and vases, but use them sparingly! No one wants to feel like they live in a museum of a thrift store.</p>\n<h3>4. Minimalist</h3>\n<p>Neutral tones. White. Lots of white. Greenery. Wooden furniture. Wooden details. Nothing extra. Nothing extravagant. Minimalist interior design takes its cues from Scandinavia and had a huge influence on Western countries in the early 90s.</p>\n<p>Minimalism is great for making small spaces look bigger thanks to light tones and minimal furniture. Some might call minimalist design boring, but I call it clean and intellectual. It’s like thinking “clean” and getting rid of things that are not necessary—in your life and in your apartment.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4691\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4691\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Minimalist, Minimalism, Scandinavian Design, Home Decor, Apartment Decor, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-770x1153.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-500x749.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-293x439.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/alexandra-gorn-493032-unsplash-1400x2097.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Alexandra Gorn from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Think simple lines, linen textures, and light color palettes when decorating your apartment like a minimalist. To void an empty, clinic-like feeling, add unexpected details. A painting by a young, unknown artist? Great choice! It shows off your personality and passion for art. Wooden side table with a funky architectural shape? Go for it, and make it the highlight of the room.</p>\n<p>Minimalism is all about quality, not quantity, and “less is more” is the rule. Combine sophisticated furniture with clean lines with small, meaningful things—like that quirky painting—to make your place feel special, while still keeping things simple.</p>\n<h3>5. Mixing and matching</h3>\n<p>Mixing-and-matching is its own trend, complete with rules and suggestions for mixing and matching different styles. The first rule that applies in mixing styles is to express yourself boldly, but—there’s always a but—don’t go crazy and overload the space. Choose a theme (like any of the styles above) and stick to that idea to create an overall feel. Then, go and have some fun!</p>\n<p>Mix old wooden chairs with colourful metal chairs around the kitchen table. Get brightly-patterned dishes and mix them with minimalistic white dishes. Hang linen curtains and throw plaid wool blankets on the couch. The possibilities are endless!</p>\n<p>The beauty of mixing and matching is in an artsy composition. First, you create a background; I personally love light grey and white walls. Then, you can start throwing splashes of colours. Select two or three colours that work together, and use them as main accents when getting pillows, paintings and coffee mugs.</p>\n<p>My own place is a mix of vintage and minimalist styles. I have piles of old books scattered around, paintings, black-white photographs, and a yellow 50s-style couch. I use simple wooden, grey, or white furniture as a background that I can add color to. Pillows and blankets are my two favourite accents that I can change depending on the season and my mood. While I stick to neutral colours in general, drops of colours are seen in details like bohemian dishware, my blue office chair, and colourful and light wooden photo frames.</p>\n<p>Furnishing an apartment should feel exciting and fun! You just need some patience to find those special pieces, loving eyes, time, and a will to create an outstanding space around yourself.</p>\n<p><em>So which side are you on—mixing and matching, or sticking to one style throughout?</em></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to interior design, mixing and matching styles makes it look like you know what you are doing.
