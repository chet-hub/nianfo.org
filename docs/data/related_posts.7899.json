There are many great places to go fishing. Whether you want to make the day or weekend of it, fishing in Manitoba is another must-do. When it comes to the best fishing spots, there is somewhere to go in any part of the province and cities that make it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Father and son walking with fishing gear towards a lake\" class=\"wp-image-7905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are going to try and make the most of fishing in Manitoba, you can quickly turn your plans into a day or weekend trip. With many of our best hot spots being within 10 to 45 minutes of not only Winnipeg but each other, you can easily plan either a day or weekend of fishing throughout Manitoba this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about these Manitoba attractions is they have much more to offer than a great catch. All of these beautiful views have much more to offer, like hiking, trail walking, resorts, casinos, restaurants, and so much more. No matter what you like to do when you get away, get away to these favorite Manitoba destinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hiking, Beaches, and More Nature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another fun Manitoba getaway idea is to take a shorter trip to one, or more of these Manitoba gems, no matter what you feel like doing. These spots are famous for their nature to see, trails to blaze, and beaches to laze.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Birds Hill Park</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/park-maps-and-locations/central/birds.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Birds Hill Park</a> is a great stop or destination for a day trip. With multiple walking and hiking trails, an artificial beach, and lots of great ways to enjoy nature within 30 minutes of Winnipeg. If you are stopping at Bird&#8217;s Hill Park, you want to make sure you visit the very beautiful and famous Pine Ridge Hollow for dinner or drinks. Pineridge is a unique restaurant experience, with its own local crafty gift shop and goats to pet; it is one of my favorite things to include in any trip to rural Manitoba.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lockport</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Located just at the end of Henderson Highway within 45 minutes from Winnipeg is Lockport. Lockport holds a high reputation for its fishing and diners, making it a great all-day experience. Lockport has always been famous for its two vintage diners, Skinners and the Half Moon. While Skinner&#8217;s historic waterslide may be shut down, you can still enjoy Skinners Diner in full swing serving its world-famous foot-long hot dogs and delicious shakes while listening to your table&#8217;s jukebox in its classic 50s themed (more like preserved) diner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Couple drinking milk shake\" class=\"wp-image-7910\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After dinner and less than just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Skinners is the Half Moon drive-in. With delicious food and shakes, and certainly not any less famous than its sister, is this other local legend. The Half Moon is another vintage Lockport specialty you won&#8217;t want to miss out on your day trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gimli</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gimli.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gimli</a> is one of Manitoba&#8217;s best day trips.
