Clementine will enchant your taste buds with dishes that burst with flavour, at a price you won’t be mad about.</p>\n<p>Clementine is a true hidden gem in the middle of downtown Winnipeg. Located in the Exchange District at 123 Princess Street, this cozy restaurant is accessible only by a stairwell wedged between a Subway and a bar. Walk too fast, and you just might miss it. You would never guess that hidden behind a plain black door that reads “123” would be a welcoming, intimate restaurant humming with the low voices of diners discussing how tasty their meals are.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4483\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4483\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4483\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Clementine1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Clementine, Breakfast, Eggs Benedict, Exchange District, Shop Local,Cappuccino, Mimosa,Burger Dip, Downtown Living\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Clementine1-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4483\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Burger Dip 2.0, Braised Bacon Benedict paired with cappuccino and grapefruit mimosa</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Atmosphere</h3>\n<p>As you descend the stairs, you’ll be met with a neon light sign suggesting, “Eat this, it’ll help.” The sign doesn’t lie, and you won’t be disappointed. A drawback of this otherwise standout restaurant is that it isn’t accessible for folks who depend on a wheelchair or are not able to walk down stairs. Sadly, Clementine is only accessible via a staircase down from street level.</p>\n<p>Warm colours, lights and textures decorate the space, creating a cozy atmosphere that pairs perfectly with a constant buzz of conversation.</p>\n<p>Another neat feature is that the kitchen is in full view, so you can enjoy watching the staff promptly prepare your fresh meal while you sip your cappuccino.</p>\n<h3>The Menu</h3>\n<p>Don’t expect your average all-Canadian breakfasts like any chain restaurant. Clementine’s menu is packed with originality and superb flavors make this restaurant my number-one recommendation for breakfast or lunch.</p>\n<p>Breakfast-brunch-lunch dishes with global influence makes Clementine the “go to” for hipsters, young families, and silver-haired couples alike. Clementine is known for short, but mouth-watering menu. The menu is creative and well-thought out, with an assortment of dishes for every palate.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BiZxVs9BL6Z/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

For instance, enjoy their porridge with mixed grains, coconut, pineapple purée, berries and cashews; or, be transported to Belgium with their perfectly fluffy Brussels Style Waffle (pictured above), topped with roasted berries, caramelized bananas, cinnamon whipped cream and maple syrup. Warning. Your mouth will water.</p>\n<p>If you’re like me and coffee is your main food group, Clementine does not disappoint. Whether you’re looking for an espresso, latte, cappuccino, or—for the truly coffee-savvy—a piccolo, they offer it!</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> If you want to play it safe, Fried Chicken on Toast (trust me!); if you are feeling a bit more adventurous, the Mushroom Chilaquiles is superb!</p>\n<h3>You’re a Guest not a Customer</h3>\n<p>The service is unbeatable, with staff who are warm and attentive. They have no issue offering you or your group suggestions or explanations for their unique menu options. One peek into their bustling kitchen, and you’ll see how hard their team works to provide you with a truly delicious dish!</p>\n<h3>Good to Know</h3>\n<p>Clementine’s one downside is that they are open from 7 am to 3 pm (weekdays) and 8 am to 4 pm (weekends), so your after-work cravings will have to wait! They also get busy fast. If you’re looking for a quick breakfast, I highly recommend arriving before 10 am on the weekends and 9:30 on weekdays. They do not take reservations.</p>\n<p>Clementine is very accommodating to special dietary needs. They offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.</p>\n<p>Dishes range from $6 to $15.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking for a breakfast/brunch/lunch option other than the usual pancakes or basic bacon and eggs?

There’s something special about half of your city piling onto the streets, decked out in white and the hometown team’s apparel.</p>\n<p>Starting this year, there’s a cover fee of $5.00, but the fun you will have is priceless. All proceeds are going to <a href=\"https://unitedwaywinnipeg.ca/\">The United Way</a>, which will scatter the funds to several organizations in the city helping individuals with mental health and addiction services.</p>\n<p>But that seems to be the only thing that’s changing—seasoned whiteout goers can expect to see the same parties, with huge screens playing the game, local food trucks, beverages (both adult and youth-friendly), snacks, and activities. If you have tots in tow, the alcohol-free family zone at the <a href=\"http://winnipeglibraryfoundation.ca/tour-the-park/\">Millennium Library Park</a> has room for up to 4,000 people!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4185\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Cup, Winnipeg White Out Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Events, Go Jets Go, Winnipeg Jets, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Ice Hockey, Sports, Game Day, #WPGWhiteOut\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Prepare for a Whiteout</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties start exactly 2 hours before each game and the streets get packed fast, so make sure to get there on time if you want to get the full whiteout experience. <a href=\"https://www1.ticketmaster.ca/winnipeg-jets-whiteout-street-party-home-game-2/event/11005682CCE54415\">Buying a ticket</a> doesn’t guarantee you a spot on the street. The street party is capped at 15,000 people for safety reasons (unless you have a ticket to the game).</p>\n<p>From personal experience, I recommend coordinating beforehand if you’re meeting a group of friends. Cell reception can be a bit dodgy and slow with the giant mass amount of people around you, and texting them “I’m by the screen, I’m the one wearing white!” doesn’t exactly work in this situation.</p>\n<p>Don’t have a white Winnipeg Jets jersey? Don’t fret! Every white get-up is welcome, even a basic white tee-shirt. If you’re feeling extra festive, get creative! Grab a white wig, a white tutu, or whatever—there’s no better time to bust out that funky white hat stored in your Halloween costume box.</p>\n<h3>Pack the Essentials</h3>\n<p>Water bottle and a snack: You’re going to spend hours watching the game, chatting with your friends, and just enjoying the hustle and bustle of the party. Stay hydrated and energized by keeping a small snack and a water bottle with you. This also will save you a few bucks!</p>\n<p>Battery Pack: You’re going to want to capture every Instagram-worthy moment, and that is going to drain your phone fast!</p>\n<p>Jacket: As we get further into spring, we Winnipeggers tend to get a bit overconfident about what will be warm enough for us to wear. It may not be that cold at 5 pm when the parties start, but towards the end of the night, you’ll want something to wrap around you. Pack a lightweight jacket (white, obviously) just in case!</p>\n<h3>Get Around Downtown</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties are great for those of us going, but if you can’t make the excitement, navigating around downtown can be torturous! Here are the roads that will be closed during whiteout parties:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economicdevelopmentwinnipeg.com/winnipeg-whiteout/maps-and-resources?camefrom=EMCL_2841648_134922198\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4181 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Whiteout Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Jets, Go Jets Go, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Game Day, Sports, Downtown Living\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-232x300.jpg 232w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-770x996.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-500x647.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-293x379.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-1400x1812.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1.jpg 1700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" /></a></p>\n<p>• Donald between Portage and St. Mary<br />\n• Graham between Hargrave and Smith<br />\n• Smith between Portage and St. Mary</p>\n<p>These streets will be closed from 11:30 a.m. Friday through 6:30 a.m. Saturday for today’s party.</p>\n<h3>Personal Experience</h3>\n<p>My first whiteout was last spring, and as soon as I jumped off the bus onto Graham street, it was if I walked into a different dimension! For as far as my eyes could see, everyone was decked out in white. My nose quickly caught a whiff of the food trucks surrounding me, and my ears were bulldozed with the laughter and chatter of the crowd around me. I followed a mass of people to the center of the street, where hundreds upon hundreds of people were already gathered, getting ready for the game to light up the massive screen in front of us.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be a die-hard fan for the excitement to exist in you. Before experiencing my first whiteout, I enjoyed the occasional hockey game. But as soon as the screen switched on and the first puck hit the ice, I was roaring in unison with the crowd around me. We were loud and proud, screaming the second the Jets hit the ice, singing along to the Canadian anthem, and we kept up that enthusiasm until seconds before the Jets sunk their winning goal at the end of the game. It was like the entire crowd—no, the entire city—was holding its breath. Silence overcame the streets as our eyes were glued to the screen, waiting for the puck to hit net. As soon as it did, we were like a shaken soda bottle—the street exploded in deafening cheers! There must be cracks in the foundations of the buildings around us thanks to the deafening noise the Winnipeggers on the streets were making. I am honestly surprised we didn’t get a noise complaint from our neighboring city. I hugged everyone around me, people I had never seen before—but they felt like long-lost friends.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwGJe-dA0AP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

This can be a great way to save yourself money and cut commuting time, but there are also potential pitfalls!</p>\n<p>I’ve used a home office for my writing and editing business since 2010, so I’m here to help with some tips about working from home and maintaining your sanity.</p>\n<h3>Finding a space to work</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to decide is where in your home you want to work. This can be tricky when space is tight. My first home office was in my downtown apartment. I only had one bedroom, so I couldn’t convert it to office space. I did have a large living room, so I set up my desk and office equipment on one side of it.</p>\n<p>Ensure your spot isn’t too enticing to encroach on. For example, if you have to work in your living room, setting up your desk near the front door might not work out. Your workspace could become a tempting spot to dump your coat, mail or keys when you walk in the door. Try to avoid creating your workspace in a high-traffic area, lest it become a repository for personal junk.</p>\n<p>You also need to consider lighting for your workspace. This is especially important if you’re a creative type and are doing painting, sewing, etc., in your home. Look for a spot near a window for natural sunlight. It also feels good to be able to look up and see the world while you’re hard at work.</p>\n<p>Noise will be another factor when choosing where to work. Some of you may love background noise, such as the radio or other people talking and moving about. I hate it and don’t work well with noise, so I always look for a quiet spot.</p>\n<p>Finally, try to make your space enticing to you. In my current home, we have a second bedroom for my office—but I mostly use it for business storage. I prefer working in my open kitchen at my big wooden table. I like being able to see a lot of things when I look up. If I’m at my desk in my office, I see wall. I learned too late that I should have turned my desk facing into the room instead of putting it against the wall, flanked by two big bookcases, as I don’t like feeling hemmed in while working. The moral of the story is to ensure your workspace makes you happy before you nail a desk to the wall.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4172 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Downtown Apartments, Home office, Renting\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>Having adequate storage for your business items can also be tough in a small space. You might need a big desk, filing cabinets or somewhere to keep your materials and paint. Having worked in many tight spaces, I love Ikea for their storage items because they are particularly skilled at offering goods meant for small spaces. You might have luck finding a smaller desk or storage items that can double as something else.</p>\n<p>I’ve always liked footstools that double as storage boxes. I can keep items hidden away and still have space to rest my weary feet at the end of the day. Shelving that hangs on walls is also helpful. It saves floor space and can provide a nice visual piece in your home if you load it up properly. Look for anywhere you can store things in or under to maximize your use of space.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself if you can store more items electronically, rather than needing filing cabinets for everything. You might also have items you use infrequently and can store offsite or in harder to reach places in your home. I’m prone to towering piles of papers and books, so I need to take more of my own advice.</p>\n<h3>Tax considerations</h3>\n<p>This is the un-fun stuff, but you still need to pay attention. If you work for yourself from home, you can use part of your home expenses, such as rent and hydro, as business write-offs. There is a caveat though: CRA says the space must be used exclusively for your business. If it doubles as personal use, no dice. When I was in my apartment, I couldn’t write off part of my rent because my office was smack in the middle of my living room, which I also used for personal reasons. If you only have one bedroom, you might be in this same bind. Talk to your accountant to see what you can do about making your space eligible for home office deductions.</p>\n<h3>The whole work-life balance thing</h3>\n<p>The other problem to watch out for is the temptation to be working, or thinking about working, all the time. When your home and office are the same place, it can be difficult to pull yourself out of work mode. You can be sitting on your couch watching your favourite show, and something on your desk will catch your eye and try to lure you back to work. This is another reason picking the right work spot is critical. You don’t always want your work to be staring you in the face!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4169 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>You might need to set specific boundaries for work hours to keep you from working day and night. For example, you could choose not to work or answer the phone on weekends or past 6 pm. As you spend more time working at home, you will realize what your trouble spots are, so you can create a plan to overcome them.</p>\n<p>You could also face the opposite problem. When you should be working, your TV or the book you left lying out last night might try to lure you back to leisure. You might need to set specific hours and boundaries for play time and naps that don’t keep you from earning a living. (Reading is great, but starvation is bad!)</p>\n<p>If you’re an introvert like me, you might feel tempted to never leave your home because everything you need is right there. Don’t get sucked into this vortex. We all need to go out sometimes, even if it’s just for a walk by ourselves. Try to plan regular outings. Join a professional organization related to your work, a Toastmasters club, a book club or anything else that will get you out of the house and socializing on occasion. Being a complete hermit is never a good idea.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p>Working from home can be great. I love being able to sleep late and have a commute that’s about 10 steps long. I don’t have to get gussied up to go anywhere and I can decide what I want for lunch at lunch time. The dog and I can take a break and go for a stroll midday. I even have someone to talk to in person when my husband gets home from work. But that doesn’t mean working from home is a perfect solution.</p>\n<p>To set yourself up for success, create a good workspace and plan specific work and leisure times. Talking to others who work from home is also a great way to learn new tips and coping mechanisms, so try to cultivate relationships with other self-employed people. With a little careful planning, you can have a successful work-from-home life that brings you satisfaction!</p>\n<p><em>Do you work from home?

The very first time I had been to Winnipeg was on a cold December afternoon when my family moved from Russia to Canada. Our friends met us at the airport, and we drove straight from the airport to a small city just south of Winnipeg. Winnipeg and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to know each other yet.</p>\n<p>The next few times when I visited Winnipeg with friends, we mainly went shopping at <a href=\"https://www.cfshops.com/polo-park.html\">Polo Park</a>. To really get to know the city, you need to get out and explore its oldest parts. You must open your eyes to seeing history, and your ears to hearing what the city wants to tell you. That is exactly what happened to me when I came back to Winnipeg with a pile of documents to apply to college.</p>\n<p>That morning, my sister and I had one specific mission: to explore. We got Starbucks and started our walk from the <a href=\"https://www.fairmont.com/winnipeg/\">Fairmont Hotel</a> on Portage Avenue, through the <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\">Exchange District</a>, and back to Portage Avenue. I was lifting my eyes, trying to catch architectural details on buildings like the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank on Main Street</a>, <a href=\"http://pantagesplayhouse.com/\">Pantages Playhouse Theatre</a> on Market Street, the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> on King Street, and others. I was enjoying the fresh summer morning air and a strong feeling of familiarity that was pressing on me from all sides. It was a long walk, but that morning something hit me. It was <em>déjà vu</em> feeling that I had already been in this place before. I felt like I&#8217;d seen it before, and not just once.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3876\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3876\" style=\"width: 819px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSe9ybtBCjl/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3876 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-770x963.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-293x366.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @arianneyuson from Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Later, while studying in college and spending all my free time in the Exchange District, I found out that movies about early 20th century Chicago had been shot in Winnipeg. Puzzle pieces fell into place. That is where I had seen these streets before I fell in love with them! I&#8217;d seen the <a href=\"https://mbfilmmusic.ca/en/film/filming-in-manitoba\">streets of Winnipeg in movies</a> when I still lived in Russia.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has been called &#8220;Little Chicago&#8221; or most commonly &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_District\">The Chicago of the North</a>&#8221; for good reason. At the turn of the century, Chicago and Winnipeg were rivals. Is that hard to believe? Before World War I, Winnipeg was the fastest-growing city in North America. By 1911 Winnipeg was the third-largest city in Canada. Winnipeg, like Chicago, was an international finance, industry, and transportation hub. From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, Chicago architects came to Winnipeg to practice their art and technique in buildings designs. They designed many buildings in the Exchange District. The Chicago architects&#8217; style influenced and inspired local Winnipeg architects, and the city kept growing in the Chicago style.</p>\n<p>One of the best examples of the Chicago style is the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> at 66 King Street. Personally, this building always made my imagination run towards early <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/\">Woody Allen</a> movies about New York, love, and love in New York. (Even though we’re talking about Chicago.) The building was designed by <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/atchison_jd.shtml\">J.D. Atchison</a>, a Chicago architect who moved to Winnipeg in 1905. Atchison designed nearly 100 buildings in the Exchange District area.</p>\n<p>I also want to highlight the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/confederationbuilding.shtml\">Confederation Life Building on Main Street</a>. I remember walking by that building, staring at its detail and marvelling at how much effort and creativity someone had to put into it. The Confederation Life Building was designed by a Toronto architect named <a href=\"https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=5950\">Wilson Gray</a>, who was influenced by Chicago style. This building is such an example of power, dignity, and strength that it takes your breath just for a moment. Next time you walk downtown and turn on Main Street, pay attention to the roof of the building. I promise, the details will surprise you, and perhaps inspire you to create something beautiful yourself.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3874\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Many locations in Winnipeg were inspired by the Chicago style. That’s why film directors do not hesitate to use Winnipeg streets as location sets when a plot includes scenes in 20th century Chicago. &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358135/locations\">Shall We Dance</a>,&#8221; with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, was shot in Winnipeg but set in Chicago. Just writing this makes me want to watch that movie again and point out all the familiar streets that now hold so many memories for me.</p>\n<p>Other common links between Winnipeg and Chicago are water and wind. Chicago is located on the shores of Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River; Winnipeg was born at the cross of the Assiniboine and Red rivers. Both cities are built on an open prairie area near a fresh water source. At the beginning of 20th century, Winnipeg was a transportation hub, with access to one of the longest rivers in Canada (the Assiniboine River stretches over 1,070 kilometres).</p>\n<p>Being built on open shores of lakes and rivers explains why both cities are known as windy cities. The average wind speed in Chicago is 16.6 km/hr, while Winnipeg wind speeds can reach 17.1 km/hr. If you think those are not big numbers, try to stand at the intersection of Portage and Main on a cold and windy February afternoon! Winnipeg’s wind speed is the second highest of any city in Canada, after Regina, Saskatchewan (18.4 km/hr). Chicago is also in second place, after Boston, Massachusetts (20.0 km/hr). On November 20, 1892, the Freeborn County Standard of Albert Lea, Minnesota, had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windy_City_(nickname)\">this to say</a> about Chicago being called the Windy City:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3880 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“But in another sense, Chicago is actually earning the title of the ‘windy’ city. It is one of the effects of the tall buildings, which engineers and architects apparently did not foresee that the wind is sucked down into the streets. Go ahead and walk past the Masonic Temple or the Auditorium. A day that may be perfectly calm elsewhere, will meet you with a lively breeze at the base of the buildings that will compel you to put your hand to your hat.”</p>\n<p>I’ve experienced exactly that many times while walking in downtown Winnipeg. The summer wind always tries to take my hats (but I always catch them, and lucky strangers get a laugh as I jog after my hat).</p>\n<p>Winnipeg, the Chicago of the North, has everything you need to take a trip back in time and land in 1905 Chicago. Chicago’s influence is all around: J.D. Atchison designed both the <a href=\"https://www.cmu.ca/\">Canadian Mennonite University</a>, the stunning <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank Building</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.virtual.heritagewinnipeg.com/vignettes/vignettes_039.htm\">Great-West Life building on Lombard Avenue</a>.</p>\n<p>The architecture in our city is beautiful and artistic; open your eyes, turn on your imagination, and maybe even look into the history of your favourite buildings. The effort is so worth it.</p>\n<p><em>Now, it is your turn to share!

And with the housing market rising, everyone seems to have advice about this decision. Millennials who are moving to bigger cities feel the pressure to get into the market. They’re told that buying is the smart move, and renting is just throwing away money. But is it? I took a look at the numbers and found six reasons why renting for Millennials is sometimes the best option.</p>\n<h3>“You build equity when you buy a house”</h3>\n<p>This statement is<a href=\"https://affordanything.com/is-renting-better-than-buying-should-i-rent-or-buy/\"> frequently used as an argument against renting</a>. The tenant rents for years and the landlord makes a profit, when the tenant could be using that money to save for a down payment or paying off a mortgage. On a basic level this is true, but it overstates the idea of gaining <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> from owning a property. Most 30-year mortgages build very little equity over the first 20 years, and only start building equity in the last decade. Most of your mortgage payment in the first two-thirds of time that you own a property is going towards insurance, taxes, and the organization that gave you the mortgage. Unless you’re very sure you are going to live in this house for the next 30 years, you’ll build minimal equity.</p>\n<p>House values also tend to increase with inflation. There have been very few periods in the last 100 years when house prices have risen beyond inflation, and when they did, they eventually declined when the “bubble burst.” When a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_bubble.asp\">housing bubble</a> bursts, the market value of your home quickly declines—but your mortgage debt doesn’t. Unless you get lucky and buy the right property at the exact right time in the right location, the chance of your house value rising by significantly more than the rate of inflation is minimal.</p>\n<h3>Being tied to a place for an allotted time</h3>\n<p>Millennials are lucky to have started our careers at a time dominated by technology. Many people have the freedom to work remotely from their computer. This freedom does not mesh well with a mortgage payment, which only sees equity growth in its later years. The economy is changing, and Millennials tend to go back to school or switch careers more often than baby boomers, but there’s little incentive for us to tie ourselves down to a 30-year mortgage until we know we’ll be staying in one place for a long time. Renting allows Millennials the freedom to spend money on travel, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/petesaunders1/2017/01/12/where-educated-millennials-are-moving/#f706ec0d3ccc\">starting a business</a>, or paying off student debt, rather than having money tied down in a place where you aren’t sure you will want to live for the next three decades.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3672 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Millenials, renting, buying a house, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>There are better ways to grow your wealth</h3>\n<p>Not only are the gains of equity from buying a house in some ways overstated, but if investment is your goal, there are more profitable ways to go about it. Renting can save you a lot of money on your yearly spending, and that money can be used to invest in stocks, ETF’s, Index Mutual funds, RRSP’s and other investment strategies that have a higher overall gain. As mentioned above, house prices tend to increase alongside inflation. Adjusting for that, a house in 1897 cost the same as a house in 1997. As for investing, The Financial Planning Standards Council <a href=\"https://www.tangerine.ca/forwardthinking/investing/what-is-a-realistic-rate-of-return-on-an-investment-portfolio\">states that</a>, “Return assumptions for a balanced portfolio range from 4.55%…to 6.05%.” Therefore, investing in stocks and bonds with the cash you’ve saved from renting is a more profitable option. The money you gain over years can be used to buy a home in a city that you know you’ll stay in.</p>\n<h3>Peace of mind</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/reasons-renting-is-better-than-buying.aspx\">lack of stress about maintenance or repair fees is a major perk of renting</a> as well, as the landlord or building manager responsible for these. This removes a major source of worry from your life as a renter, since you don’t have to think about replacing the furnace or the pipes if they break or hiring someone to check problems in your house. I know many homeowners who are frustrated with the amount of work they have to do just to maintain their living space. Renovations and repairs can be a huge drain, both financially and of your time. Renting allows you to spend your free time enjoying your home, not just keeping it in order.</p>\n<p>Another way renting removes stress is that you don’t have to worry about fluctuating markets and property taxes. <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/cca/rtb/rentincreaseguideline/calculate.html\">In Manitoba, the most rent can increase is 1% and 3% each year (with some exceptions)</a>, which many renters can manage. Property taxes, on the other hand, can rise by more, and the value of your home can swing wildly without you having any ability to budget for it. Knowing how much you are paying at the beginning of every month is a big stress reliever for Millennials, who often freelance and work jobs that are more fluid.</p>\n<h3>Amenities and extras</h3>\n<p>Not a lot of people have a pool, a gym, a party room, or a tennis court in their house. But with a lot of newer condominiums, these are built in! These facilities are right in the building and make exercise and social gatherings easy and affordable, which is important in our society where we all seem to be so busy. These amenities would normally require Millennials to pay a membership to a gym or club, plus transportation costs. With many buildings having these amenities built in, it saves renters both money and time. Not to mention the cost of having these perks in your home as an owner would vastly outweigh what renters spend for building fees in a year!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3674\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3674\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3674\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Amenities, Gym, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3674\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Humphrey Muleba from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Another benefit with renting a condo or apartment is that you are surrounded by a built-in community. Many of my good friends are people who rented beside me, went to the dog park at my building or who I just bumped into in my neighbourhood at some point. You’re surrounded by hundreds of neighbours in an apartment building, which can come in handy when you need someone to watch your dog for a day, borrow a drill for a project, or just want to get together with some new friends.</p>\n<h3>It is the best option</h3>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/young-money/student-debt-the-crippling-side-effect-of-education\">rising student debt</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/house-prices-affordability-income-1.4966211\">tough housing market</a>, many Millennials have no choice but to move back in with their parents after going to college or university. In these cases, for a young professional looking to live on their own, renting is a better option. The freedom of living on your own without the stress of the housing market allows Millennials to get closer to their dreams while saving up money and building a life.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/its-better-to-rent-than-to-buy-in-todays-housing-market.html\">new research</a> from Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University Faculty, “Renting and reinvesting the savings from renting, on average, will outperform owning and building home equity, in terms of wealth creation,” which can allow younger people to live the life they want. Traveling, being in a city, having a safe home, and chasing your career: all of this is possible and more attainable while renting. Renting isn’t throwing away money; you get to live in a place with all the amenities of owning a home, without any of the costs of upkeep! Don’t let old advice keep you from living your dream.</p>\n<p><em>Have you chosen to rent? Are you a happy homeowner?

Don’t waste time feeling embarrassed; we’ve all been there! Follow these quick tips and you’ll feel like you have a new apartment by spring.</p>\n<h3>Create a Schedule and Set Aside the Time</h3>\n<p>Start off by making a list of all the rooms in your apartment, and don’t forget coat closets or cleaning supplies closets! No two rooms will need the same amount of time; your bathroom might take 30 minutes whereas your bedroom could take half a day.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve identified the rooms you need to tackle, create a schedule and be specific about what you hope to accomplish in each room. For example, your goal for your kitchen might be to create more countertop room, or you might want to clear more wardrobe space in your bedroom.</p>\n<h3>Out with the Old</h3>\n<p>Winter clothing can truly take a beating in these harsh chilly months. Set aside a couple of hours and inspect your wardrobe. Recycle any hole-infested sweaters and worn-down thermal socks.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3617\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3617\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3617\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3617\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Dan Gold from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Clothes are one of the easiest things to collect and hoard within your home. Ask yourself, “Have I worn this in the past 6 months?” If you haven’t (be honest!) and there’s no sentimental value to it (like a wedding dress or your grandmother’s hand-knit sweater,) donate it. You’ll thank yourself later when looking for your favourite shirt doesn’t count as an arm workout.</p>\n<p>If you are anything like me, you fear getting rid of stuff because you can’t help but think, “<em>But what if I need this later?</em>” Trust me on this: You’re never going to need those hotel toiletries you snagged on your past six vacations, or that one phone charger that works when you place it just right—it’s time to toss ‘em!</p>\n<h3>Become Friends with your Countertops and Tables Again</h3>\n<p>Flat surfaces in your apartment accumulate the most clutter because it’s just so easy to let things pile up. Remove every item from the surface, including decorations, appliances and all the haphazard junk. Lay everything out on a flat surface like another table (or even the floor), so you have a clear view of each item.</p>\n<p>An easy place to start is by throwing away all the random flyers, coupons and other non-important loose papers that tend to accumulate. Next, tackle things that spark more annoyance than joy, such as decorations you don’t remember buying.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve picked the items worthy of being on your counter or table, find a permanent home for them in a convenient and logical spot. Be selective of what you keep on your counters; you don’t need to have every single appliance on the counter! If you don’t use it every day, store it in a cabinet or on top of the fridge.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Forget to Tackle the Junk Drawer</h3>\n<p>Drawers are the first place you throw miscellaneous stuff into, especially when you’re quickly tidying up. I get it; out of sight, out of mind. But this spring, we’re reversing that mindset! The purpose of a junk drawer is to provide a place to store all the little odds and ends that don&#8217;t quite fit in anywhere else. This is still possible, but it can be done in a more intentional way.</p>\n<p>Toss anything that is expired, unnecessary or is just plain garbage. Keep extra batteries, packs of pens and chip clips, but get rid of extra chopsticks, expired coupons, and that stack of random business cards.</p>\n<h3>Ready, Shreddy, Go!</h3>\n<p>Paper junk can collect quickly, like old receipts, bank invoices or even more of those random business cards. Shredding these will clear up your office space.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3623\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3623\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3623\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-169x300.jpg 169w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-770x1369.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-500x889.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-293x521.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2.jpg 838w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3623\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Felipe Bustillo from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Collections of any Kinds Have to Go</h3>\n<p>Items like books, CD’s or DVD’s can really pile up over the years. Ask yourself if these mementos are necessary, or just part of your past that you’re holding onto. It’s a brave, new virtual world, and most of us don’t even have CD/DVD players any more thanks to Netflix. So why are you wasting space for stacks of CDs from the early 2000s?</p>\n<p>The same thing goes for books. It might be nice to look like a bookworm when your friends pop by, but you know they’re mostly just taking up space. This doesn’t mean you have to give up every book but ask yourself if you’ll really ever read it again. If you won’t, donate it.</p>\n<p>Quick Tip: Donate your books to newcomer organizations (such as N.E.E.D.S) or a senior living facility!</p>\n<h3>Be Ruthless</h3>\n<p>Getting rid of stuff in your home is difficult at first because we create connections with items. But, once you get the hang of it, you’ll wonder why you didn’t tackle it sooner!</p>\n<h3>Organize the Rest</h3>\n<p>Decluttering isn’t just about getting rid of stuff; it’s also about knowing how to manage what you have. From racks, baskets, or under-bed storage, there’s an assortment of storage products for every need on the market.</p>\n<h3>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</h3>\n<p>A forgotten place that is one of the most convenient storage spaces is hiding out under your bed. Grab a few thin, narrow bins and you have the perfect place to store out of season clothes, booksyou want to keep but don’t need on your shelf, or any mish-mashed items that don’t seem to have a place but that you know you need.</p>\n<p>Shelving units are also a great way to kill two birds with one stone: Grab a few baskets and tuck away all those miscellaneous items such as cords or craft supplies. Your shelves will look neat and aesthetically pleasing, and what they hold is your little secret.</p>\n<h3>Celebrate!</h3>\n<p>Now that your hard work is over, sit back and celebrate Apartment 2.0! Now your mission is to keep your home decluttered. Remember to follow the golden rule: Only bring things into your home that you actually need and will use. Once your apartment is decluttered, it’s easy to follow into old habits and end up buying more stuff you don’t need.</p>\n<p>Before bringing something new into your home, ask yourself, “Do I need this? How will this benefit my home?” If you can’t answer both questions, don’t buy it. Another great trick is the one in, one out rule. For every item that comes into your apartment, try to get rid of one item so you don’t end up with a cluttered apartment once again.</p>\n<p>These tips might seem ambitious, but you can do it! And once you see how freeing it can feel to have less <em>stuff</em> around you, you’ll be kicking yourself for not starting sooner.
