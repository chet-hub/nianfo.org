He would be on time for his career counselling session at <a href=\"https://manitobastart.com/\">Manitoba Start</a>, just a few blocks away. This was his first session, and he breathed an inward sigh of relief that such a great resource was so close to his apartment building. He had just arrived last week and was eager to get settled. Securing a <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/mbcard.html\">Manitoba Health Card</a> and finding a family doctor had been fairly easy. He had even been able to use the free services of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit</a> bus since everything was within a few blocks of his new apartment in downtown.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-04-17T15:34:01+00:00\">Apr 17, 2018 at 8:34am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>As he walked to his destination, Henry cast a cursory glance around him. He was amazed at the diversity; people of all ethnicities and ages walked past him, in harmony with each other yet comfortably oblivious to their own surroundings. He noticed people rushing to work, too rushed to drink their coffee yet taking the time to hold open doors for others. He was falling in love with his new home! He felt a sense of belonging and was already looking forward to the weekend. He had seen posters for <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/\">ManyFest</a> and was excited to be living a short walk from where all the action would be. As he rushed across the cross walk, he thought about his plans for the coming weekend: the festival, a visit to the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/\">public library</a> to check out their collection and perhaps some Indian cuisine at a nearby restaurant. He realized he was talking to himself as he entered the the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/downtown_winnipeg_indoor_walkway_map_2013.pdf\">Downtown Winnipeg Indoor Walkway (lovingly known as the skywalk by locals)</a> to escape the gust of wind that threatened to sweep away the documents that he had been carrying. He shook his head, smiling. He couldn’t wait to get back to his apartment to finish settling in. His days now began with sipping his morning tea while waiting for the sun to light up the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/docs/goldenboy_factsheet.pdf\">Golden Boy</a> as it serenely overlooked downtown. For the tenth time that day, he made a mental note to thank the friend who had suggested he find a place downtown to start his new life in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Heather’s iPhotos (@heathers.iphotos)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-10T05:13:20+00:00\">Dec 9, 2018 at 9:13pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>Starting a new life in an unfamiliar city can be unnerving. Resources are limited, expectations are high and there is always too much to do. That’s why it is important to choose a location that can help you get things done on the fast track. Living at the heart of the city and near all the major institutions not only saves precious time, but also gives the added advantage of being mobile even if you’re not ready to own a vehicle. It’s cost-effective to be able to walk to most places which is exactly what you’re looking for when starting your life in a new city. Better to burn calories than cents when you’re relying on your savings!</p>\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is also a great place to network, which is invaluable when you’re adjusting to a new culture and looking for a job in your field. You need to be at the right place at the right time. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html\">Service Canada</a> in <a href=\"https://portageplace.ca/\">Portage Place</a> offers free resources for job seekers.

Looking to relax after a long working week? That’s the beauty of downtown: it’s home to a lot of tourist attractions and entertainment spots. Whether it’s a stroll through the beautiful grounds at <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> or a <a href=\"http://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/movies-on-memorial/\">movie in Memorial Park</a>, everything is within reach. If you need to use <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en\">Winnipeg Transit</a>, most major bus routes run right through downtown, making it easy to get around! There are convenient options for grocery shopping, and a plethora of ethnic stores makes for a diverse retail environment that caters to a multicultural community.</p>\n<p>And downtown Winnipeg is exceptionally multicultural. You’ll see Diwali celebrations happening amidst decorations waiting for the Christmas season to gain momentum, and people rushing for Eid prayers right after Easter wraps up. There is something for everyone here: the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/\">Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG)</a> for the art enthusiast who wants to analyse each piece, free yoga classes in Memorial Park for the fitness freak, and tons of delectable dining options for the foodie. And in case you’re all three, everything is always only a few blocks away! <a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/\">The Downtown Winnipeg Biz</a> is a great resource for finding ways to experience the best Winnipeg has to offer.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking about starting a new chapter of your life in Winnipeg, look no further than downtown—and I mean literally!

The area is bustling with development, including <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a>, and 2019 is already shaping up to be jam-packed with events. Here’s a look at some of the great happenings you’ll want to jot down in your calendar.</p>\n<h3>Do You Like Music?</h3>\n<p>There will be concerts galore—including headliners from multiple decades—at <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/\">Bell MTS Place</a>. <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3802297&amp;event=Justin+Timberlake\">Justin Timberlake</a> will be the major draw in February. April sees the legendary <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3824243&amp;event=Fleetwood+Mac\">Fleetwood Mac</a> come to town on the 11th, while Canadian rockers <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3823211&amp;event=Metric\">Metric</a> play on the 23rd. Country sensation <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3659325&amp;event=Carrie+Underwood%2C+Maddie+and+Tae+%26+Runaway+June\">Carrie Underwood</a> comes through on June 2nd. And taking you back to the 1980s is <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3811949&amp;event=Corey+Hart\">Corey Hart</a> on June 18th. If you go, report back on whether he still wears his sunglasses at night. (Sorry. Had to.) To see a full list of events, check out the <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/calendar/\">Bell MTS Place events calendar</a>.</p>\n<h3>Looking for Some Culture?</h3>\n<p>The ballet, opera and symphony all operate out of the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, and with the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/\">Royal Manitoba Theatre Company</a> (Royal MTC) around the corner, there is always something new to watch downtown. The <a href=\"https://buy.rwb.org/single/EventListing.aspx\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> (RWB) performs <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/romeo-juliet/\">Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> February 13th through 17th. I’ve seen this one before and can vouch for the gorgeous costumes and delightful choreography. If you’re looking for a show that will entrance young kids, the RWB will perform <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/the-wizard-of-oz/\">The Wizard of Oz</a> from May 1st to 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbopera.ca/season/the-barber-of-seville/\">Manitoba Opera</a> is putting on one of my favourite operas this spring, The Barber of Seville. This one’s a comedy, so don’t expect a long dirge. When you hear “Figaro, Figaro, Fiiiigaro!” being belted out onstage, you might recognize the famous aria featured in the Looney Tunes “Rabbit of Seville.” <a href=\"https://tickets.mbopera.ca/TheatreManager/1/login?event=281\">The Barber of Seville</a> runs April 6th, 9th and 12th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2605 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical, Musical, Theatre, Show, Downtown Winnipeg, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC), Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-500x171.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-300x103.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-768x263.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1370x470.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Tickets.aspx\">Royal MTC</a> fans, you can catch <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\">Matilda the Musical</a> (based on the Roald Dahl Book) from January 8th to February 2nd . Another option is <a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">A Doll’s House</a> from January 30st to February 16th. I’ve never heard of this one, but the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">description</a> sounds intriguing: “Henrik Ibsen’s realist masterpiece resonates more than a century after the debut of Nora Helmer, whose bourgeois illusions are shattered by the realization that she’s merely a doll in her own home.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO)</a> has events for all tastes throughout the year. The one I find most intriguing <a href=\"https://wso.ca/1819season/\">this season</a> is <a href=\"https://wso.ca/star-wars-star-trek/\">Star Wars vs. Star Trek</a>, running February 22nd to 24th. According to the WSO, “Special guest hosts Brett Megarry and Jeff Braun, from <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/winnipeg/program/couch-potatoes-cjob\">CJOB’s The Couch Potatoes</a>, settle the score with iconic music from both a galaxy far, far away and where no man has gone before.”</p>\n<p>And my last theatre recommendation is the smash musical <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=KinkyBoots&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=\">Kinky Boots</a>. The Centennial Concert Hall’s got this one from April 16th through 21st. I’ve only seen the movie version of this, and it was great. Expect the musical to be even better.</p>\n<h3>Want to Stay Warm and Burn Some Calories?</h3>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0px auto 12px; width: 50px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0px 7px; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by The Forks (@theforkswinnipeg)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-28T18:34:57+00:00\">Dec 28, 2018 at 10:34am PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/red-river-mutual-trail\">Red River Mutual Trail</a> should be open again soon (once we get some colder weather). Head down to the Forks to rent some skates and check out the world-famous <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts</a>. There are five new ones this year, including a performance hut. Norwegian ice musician <a href=\"https://wso.ca/blog/wnmf-2019-preview/\">Terje Isunget</a> will perform with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra using instruments carved from Red River ice. Sounds fascinating to me!</p>\n<p>If you want more exercise, you can always sign up for the <a href=\"https://wildwintercanoerace.com/\">Wild Winter Canoe Race</a> at <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/a-z-guide/\">Shaw Park</a> on February 16th. This involves finding a group of friends to “canoe” across the snow. (You move the canoe with your feet, like the most Canadian skateboard ever.) No need to bring your own canoe; the event will provide one for you.

Their recently-launched <a href=\"http://amsterdamtearoom.com/dinner-menu/\">new menu</a> had popped up in several of my friends’ Instagram stories, and I was eager to try it myself. The last time I’d been there, it was a quaint little tea room; it’s since transformed into a busy, hip tea bar. We grabbed seats at the bar and I ordered a hot toddy and a small plate with crispy fingerling potatoes, charred onion, cucumber, celery, ketchup aioli, mustard seeds, sesame, and pecorino cheese. The server told me that if I took a little bit of all the components of the dish in one big bite, it would taste like a Big Mac—yum!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2564\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2564\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2564 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Derek McCandless, Live Music, Amsterdam Tea Room, Exchange District, First Fridays in the Exchange, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-1370x913.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2564\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winnipeg Folk Fest performer, Derek McCandless performing at Amsterdam Tea Room on First Fridays in the Exchange on December 7, 2018.

The bar was buzzing with people, the chatter blending seamlessly into his soothing voice and guitar notes. We made a game plan and left with our bellies full, ready to take on the night.</p>\n<p>Our next stop was at <a href=\"https://www.graffitigallery.ca/\">Graffiti Gallery</a> (109 Higgins Avenue) for the opening reception of WOMAN GOOD BAD BAD: a series of all-new work by Winnipeg artist <a href=\"https://gabriellewmfunk.com/\">Gabrielle Funk</a>. The gallery floor was deliciously pink, and I fell in love instantly. Abstract pastel graphics on the walls seemed to blend in with the artwork. I later learned that the gallery is modified before every exhibition to match the artwork and create a cohesive experience.</p>\n<p>People milled about the gallery with wine glasses and kombucha bottles, bobbing their heads to music from the DJ in the corner. There were free appetizers and a cash bar, and the artwork itself was beautiful. Most of the paintings were based on friends and family members of the artist, and the faces look extremely realistic yet surreal. Through this show, Funk explores the duality of the conventional representation of women in religion, art, and the media.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2566\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2566\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2566\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Davis Studio Boutique, First Fridays in the Exchange, Exchange District, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-1370x2055.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A collection of painting by artist, Joshua Wilson at tara davis studio boutique.

It’s an eclectic and charming boutique at 246 McDermot Avenue, carrying womenswear, art, accessories, and home décor. The exhibit was called “12”—the 7th annual exhibition of 12 local artists showing 12 small works no larger than 12&#215;12”. One of the collections that caught my attention was by Joshua Wilson, an artist who paints quirky pictures of animals with cigarettes. I really wanted to take home a painting of a crab with a cigarette, but I settled for a pair of mismatched purple socks with cacti on them.</p>\n<p>My friend and I parted ways, and I walked over to <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/cinematheque/\">Cinematheque</a> (304-100 Arthur Street) for my last stop of the night: a screening of <em><a href=\"https://streamingmoviesright.com/us/movie/sorry-to-bother-you\">SORRY TO BOTHER YOU</a></em>, presented by Black Space Winnipeg. I was a little wary of going to this with just my popcorn for company, but in Winnipeg, six degrees of separation is a very real thing. I ran into friends from work and someone I went to school with, so I joined them for the movie.</p>\n<p>Cinematheque is one of those old-school movie theaters that brings back the romance of movie watching. The architecture of the <a href=\"https://art-space.ca/artspace-building/\">ArtSpace</a> building is stunning and the theatres are small and intimate. Before heading into the showing, I stopped at the bar for a glass of wine to go with my popcorn.</p>\n<p>The movie started a little late, but no one seemed to mind. Written and directed by Boots Riley and starring <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3147751/\">Lakeith Stanfield</a>, Sorry to Bother You is a dystopian comedy that addresses societal issues like racism and commercialism. (The ending will leave you feeling unsettled in the best way possible.) It’s both thoughtful and hilarious, with tremendous actors.</p>\n<p>It was almost midnight by the time the movie ended. Over at <a href=\"https://www.thetallestpoppy.com/\">The Tallest Poppy</a> (103 Sherbrook Street), <a href=\"https://www.synonymartconsultation.com/\">Synonym</a>’s First Friday After Party would be just starting to heat up. But after a full evening of soaking up culture and art, I was ready to head back home.</p>\n<p>By midnight, I had only managed to fit in four of the 36 great events happening that night. I hope to go back this week to catch some of the venues I missed.

However, your apartment isn’t just a place to crash—it&#8217;s your home. And every home feels livelier and friendlier with a little greenery. If you don’t consider yourself a Green Thumb, don’t be intimidated—there are voluminous solutions even for the serial plant killers out there!</p>\n<p>Here are just a few ways to bring the beauty of nature into your living space with this selection of some of the finest and easiest plants for your high-rise apartment at 300 Main.</p>\n<h3>Cacti</h3>\n<p>If you love variety, cacti are the way to go. Cacti are available in all sorts and in an abundance of shapes and sizes, making them the perfect plant to help your apartment look “sharp.”</p>\n<p>The upkeep of cacti is as simple as it gets. These easy-to-care-for plants can endure the desert, so if you have a window available, it is more than likely your apartment will be an equally equipped environment to provide these plants with everything they need to thrive. These prickly fellas only need to be watered weekly and need at least four to five hours of direct sunlight a day. Placing them on a window sill will ensure their proper growth—and you’re out of the prick zone!</p>\n<h6><em>Quick Tip:</em></h6>\n<p>During our sub-zero months here in Winnipeg, take care not to place your cacti right up against a window. Choose a higher table or stand by a window to ensure your cacti are still receiving sunlight but able to bask in your heated apartment.</p>\n<h3>Succulents</h3>\n<p>Succulents are resilient, low maintenance, and come in a variety of structures and colors, making them ideal candidates for your own planted arrangement! While succulents do enjoy light, think of them as small children at the beach: Watch that they’re not in direct sunlight for long periods of time (for example, on a window sill). Contrary to common belief, these colorful beings do not thrive when met with scorching temperatures and full-on sun exposure. Succulents need a deep watering once a week during their active growth period, but do not mistake this for drowning the vibrant plant.</p>\n<p>Indoor succulent pots do not require a drainage hole because they should never be watered so much that water leaks from the base. This attribute makes them the perfect plants to put in a hanging pot. You can let their greenery reach the highest of corners of your apartment for an aesthetically pleasing display; or consider showcasing your succulents in a terrarium. A terrarium is a fun addition to your apartment décor.</p>\n<h3>Mint Plants</h3>\n<p>You don’t need your own garden to harvest herb—mint plants flourish indoors. Place these minty seedlings on a window sill in your kitchen (or a window sill of your preference) and water them</p>\n<p>four times a week. This may seem like a hassle, but once a mint leaf has fully blossomed, you can snip it off and throw it into your tea or add some fresh flavour to an old recipe.</p>\n<h3>Basil Plants</h3>\n<p>Like mint, basil plants grow well indoors. Plop them next to your mint plants on the window sill, water every three to four days, and you’ve got your own herb garden in the making. Just like mint, basil leaves are a great resource to have in your kitchen. Chop fresh basil into your sauces or sprinkle onto your homemade pizzas. A little bit of basil tastes great in soups and stews, too.</p>\n<h6><em>Quick Tip for Mint and Basil Plants:</em></h6>\n<p>You can purchase fully-grown mint and basil plants at any local garden centre, or you can buy the seeds and grow them yourself. For the latter option, be prepared to wait two weeks before you see growth above the soil line. When you do see your own little plants popping up, the waiting will pay off!</p>\n<h3>Aloe Vera</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking for a plant with function, look no further than aloe. It may be an odd-looking plant, but it provides a useful balm that is handy for sunburns and scrapes. Of additional value, aloe helps purify your stuffy apartment air.</p>\n<p>It thrives in moist soil, so be sure to water it regularly and give it plenty of bright, indirect light.</p>\n<h3>Bamboo Plants</h3>\n<p>If the spaces near your windows are becoming crowded, consider a bamboo branch. Bamboo plants only need water and shade to survive, making them ideal houseplants for hallways, corners of rooms or areas that lack sunlight at all hours of the day.</p>\n<p>If your newly purchased bamboo plant is at the initial phases of its growth, water the young plant twice a week for the first six months. For an aged bamboo plant, watering every seven to ten days will be enough to keep your bamboo nourished and healthy.</p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2518 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Indoor Plant, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Plants\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-768x960.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-1370x1713.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Fiddle-leaf Fig Trees</h3>\n<p>The upkeep of a fiddle-leaf fig tree is a bit trickier, but not so much that you shouldn’t enjoy its essence in your home. A fig tree is not unlike an angst-filled teenager: Give it space when needed!</p>\n<p>Place a fiddle-leaf fig tree at least five feet away from a window. This should be a space in your apartment where sun rays will hit it, but not constantly throughout the day. The watering routine will depend on the moistness of the soil. Touch the soil and if it is still wet from its last watering five days ago, leave it alone. The tree only needs to be watered when the top few inches of the soil are dry; then it’s time to give your plant a drink.</p>\n<h6><em>Quick tip:</em></h6>\n<p>Just like teenagers, fiddle-leaf fig trees have growth spurts. If you purchase the fig tree when it is just budding, expect rapid growth in the beginning. Fiddle-leaf fig trees grow as tall as six feet, but in most cases, the plant tops at four feet while indoors. If you have low ceilings in your apartment, you can trim the leaves to accompany your space.</p>\n<h3>Anthurium</h3>\n<p>If you are looking to add a pop of colour in your space, anthurium is the perfect indoor flower for apartment living. This flower can tolerate all types of light but will grow best with bright, indirect light. If you have a window with a constructed view of the sun or a surface close enough to a source of light, these are ideal locations for anthurium.</p>\n<h3>Enjoy your Urban Jungle!</h3>\n<p>Indoor pants help transform a space into a home. Adding plants is literally adding life to your home! Being intentional about bringing nature into your space will make your downtown apartment an oasis of rest from the hustle and bustle of urban living.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Between your 9-5 job, Tuesday Yoga classes and drinks with that online date, plant upkeep is at the back of your mind.

Located in Peg Beer Co.’s previous location behind the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, Nonsuch had a soft opening during <a href=\"http://nuitblanchewinnipeg.ca/\">Nuit Blanche</a>, exhibiting dozens of golden umbrellas on its ceiling, illuminated by just as many light bulbs. The room is tastefully decorated with black walls, so-comfy-you-sink-in-them sofas, and modern furniture. The vibe is very relaxed, perfect for both groups and couples.</p>\n<p>Everything on their menu is $7: every beer, ranging from a Belgian blonde to a Baltic porter, is $7 (those with a higher ABV are served in slightly smaller quantity). Nosh on a delicious fruit and nut plate or dig into a massive bowl of popcorn with your choice of dill, chilli pepper, or truffle seasoning.

The bar offers light bites, wine and beer, premium spirits (like mezcal and <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/c/35/japanese-whisky\">Japanese whisky</a>), and great cocktails.

If an establishment has Delirium at all, it’s almost always <a href=\"https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/delirium-tremens/1039/\">Delirium Tremens</a>. Which is why I was so happy to see that in addition to tapas and wine, Cordova also specializes in Belgian beers—complete with the Delirium sign hanging above the bar! My ecstasy at finding Delirium Nocturnum in Winnipeg aside, Cordova is also a fabulous spot for a nightcap.</p>\n<p>They have an extensive wine selection, carefully crafted cocktails, and delicious tapas. The candlelit atmosphere makes Cordova the perfect spot for an intimate nightcap over a bottle of wine and shared small plates, and it’s a must-stop for any Belgian beer aficionado.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">Smith</a></h3>\n<p>75 Forks Market Rd<br />\nMonday to Thursday, 6:30 am to 11 pm<br />\nFriday to Saturday, 6:30 am to 12 am<br />\nSunday, 7 am to 11 pm<br />\n<a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">smithrestaurant.ca</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2056\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2056\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BREdkWXhwJV/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2056\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Winnipeg, Smith Restaurant, Hang out place, Cozy, Lounge\" width=\"940\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-500x325.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-300x195.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-768x498.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @smithwinnipeg on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I realized a few years ago that hotel bars are extremely underrated. They’re usually quiet, relaxed, open late, and offer a great selection of food and drinks and amazing service. Hotel bars just aren’t the first place most people think about when they want to get a drink somewhere! But you don’t need to be a hotel guest to enjoy the hotel bar.</p>\n<p>My favourite hotel bar in the city, and one I’ve been going to for years, is Smith at the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a>. The food is phenomenal, and if you’re not up for a meal, they have a large selection of small plates and sides. (My friends and I usually order a bunch of sides to share.) They have great local beers on tap that rotate regularly, a fantastic wine selection, and some seriously good cocktails. Like, seriously good (try the mezcal and beet cocktail). They have a list of classic cocktails and a list of Smith originals. They even have their own gin! Not to mention the décor is sleek and cosy, and no one is going to bug you if you stay in your <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> blanket booth for hours.</p>\n<h4>So on a cold Winnipeg night, after the Jets have once again made their city proud and you’re craving a nightcap to finish off your evening, try something new! Think of a crisp, locally-brewed beer, a cosy speakeasy, a warm tea cocktail, a juicy glass of wine, and delicious late-night food made by some of Winnipeg’s best kitchens. <a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/\">Downtown Winnipeg</a> has a lot to offer if you know where to look…</h4>\n<p>Have you had a tantalizing nightcap at any of Elena’s favourite spots?
