Let the playing commence. May the best leprechaun win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A St. Patrick’s Day spin on Bobbing For Apples</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know and love the Halloween age-old tradition of bobbing for apples, right? Well, if you want to challenge your guests this year, try having them bob for The Lucky Charms. Get bowls of lucky charms, have one person blindfolded on each side, and try and pick out the marshmallow pieces of the lucky charms the fastest.

Check out our two favorite St. Patricks Day contests to include at your 2022 bash.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Costume Contest</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold a contest for the best St. Patricks Day costume. The prize goes to the most creative, most spirit or just the one you didn’t see coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>Cocktail Contest</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the contest idea? Get participants to make their best the cuff Irish and St. Patrick Day-themed cocktails, and may the best one win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go on a street crawl</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If none of the above fit your Irish appetite or you rather keep to yourself, try celebrating by going on your street crawl. Make sure you throw on some green to avoid getting pinched and embark on your own St Patrick&#8217;s day adventure. Try taking a walk through the city where St Patrick&#8217;s day is in full swing, and enjoy watching the city turn green!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>St. Patricks Day the Self Care Way; Keep Calm and Celebrate St Patrick!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rather stay in and keep calm this St Patricks day but still want to stay in the holiday spirit, try indulging in some St Patrick day themed self-care. Start by brewing yourself an Irish coffee, run a bath with a goat’s milk soak and green-themed oils like peppermint, and let the stress melt away to the sounds of relaxing Irish music.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hangover the Irish Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While St Patrick’s Day is a nationally beloved holiday, it is not exactly a nationally absorbed holiday in the way of anyone having the day off. Unlike New Year’s Eve, where we all have a national hangover day on January 1st (and most places on the 2nd too), not too many places close on St. Patricks Day. If you find yourself hungover and have to go to work this St. Patricks Day, try one of these Irish remedies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"941\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sp3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7534\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3.jpg 941w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Full Irish Breakfast<br>-Bacon<br>-Eggs<br>-Sausages<br>-Black Pudding<br>-Beans<br>-Fried Tomatoes</li><li>Irish Coffee<br>The best cure to a hangover for many the next day is the good old classic coffee.

Personally, I love to explore, learn and create. I enjoy studying and practice with energy &amp; holistic healing methods such as Aromatherapy, Reiki and Hypnotherapy. I spend much of my free time walking our city sites, river walks and downtown sidewalks with my trusty pup, soaking in the unique history, architecture and culture Winnipeg has to offer.","url":"https://livingat300main.ca/author/jbell/"}]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7525"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/users/25"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=7525"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7525/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7536,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7525/revisions/7536"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media/7535"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=7525"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=7525"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=7525"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"related_posts":[{"slug":"hidden-fashion-boutiques-downtown-and-in-the-exchange","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC01195-2.png","date":"2018-10-28T11:00:54","categories":[{"name":"Fashion","link":"/category/fashion/"},{"name":"Shopping","link":"/category/shopping/"}],"title":"Hidden Fashion Boutiques—Downtown and in the Exchange"},{"slug":"decorating-an-apartment-with-downtown-spirit-and-style","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dane-deaner-272375-unsplash-1370x1713-1.jpg","date":"2018-10-31T20:54:10","categories":[{"name":"Apartment","link":"/category/apartment/"},{"name":"Lifestyle","link":"/category/lifestyle/"}],"title":"Decorating an Apartment with Downtown Spirit and Style"},{"slug":"sporting-ideas-for-downtown-winnipeg","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jose-morales-571859-unsplash.jpg","date":"2018-11-08T15:55:40","categories":[{"name":"Adventure","link":"/category/adventure/"},{"name":"Downtown Events","link":"/category/downtown-events/"},{"name":"Lifestyle","link":"/category/lifestyle/"}],"title":"Sporting Ideas for Downtown Winnipeg"},{"slug":"east-vs-west-exchange","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC01300-1-2-1-1024x683.jpg","date":"2018-11-15T11:00:13","categories":[{"name":"Adventure","link":"/category/adventure/"},{"name":"Art &amp;
