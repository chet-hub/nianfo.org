So subtle and yet so powerful. And honestly, there is something so calming about looking at all the mist that flows out. I often catch myself just staring at it.  You can choose whatever combination of essential oils you like, or you can swap them around depending on your mood and time of day. Something is calming like peppermint for a meditation or yoga session and maybe some lavender for when you want to curl up on the sofa with a cup of green tea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to try out different scents till you find ‘the one.’ You can also choose to put smaller diffusers around the apartment and in the bathrooms when you’re having guests over. Everyone loves to be greeted with a fresh scent, whether they are entering the main door or the bathroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of aromatherapy are numerous. It can help you relax, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety—all great things in today’s stressful and fast lifestyle. After a tiring day, you would want to come back to your little haven. And let’s be honest, no one likes a stinky haven. And the good news is, there is no one right way to make your home smell good. There are so many options out there that you’re bound to find one that suits your needs and lifestyle. You just have to take the first step to find out what works best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7566\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scented candles are another way to make your living space smell heavenly, especially if you’re the kind of person who likes warm tones. You can try out vanilla if you want to go subtle, cinnamon for a spicier feel, and flowery scents if you really want to feel like spring is in the air or in your living room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candles also really add some personality to a living room. They come in different sizes and styles, so you can choose a minimalistic version that is not too conspicuous or go for something fancy if you really want people to notice the source of the heavenly scent that will be coming from your home this spring!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1344\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7567\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3.jpg 1344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Burning incense can also be an interesting way to freshen up the scent in your home. It can help to reduce anxiety and would go well with a meditation session. The scented smoke would work well for a spiritual purpose, but if you are sensitive to inhaling smoke, then this might not be the best option for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a DIY kind of person and like to keep things basic, just throw in some orange and lemon slices with cinnamon sticks in a pot of water and let it boil. Your kitchen will smell of citrusy and cinnamon goodness in no time! Or better yet, bake a batch of cookies if you really want some authentic vanilla and cinnamon scent in the kitchen and also have something to munch on while you enjoy the yummy smell!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If candles and diffusers are too much for you and you are looking for a more subtle way to improve the way your home smells, then reed diffusers might be your best bet. They look classy, the fragrance isn’t too strong, and there are a lot of options to choose from! Also, if you like being safe, there are no flames or electric plug-ins involved, so you don’t have to worry about switching it off or blowing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-1024x687.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7568\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-770x516.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-500x335.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4.jpg 1299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to really get creative and enjoy a great smelling room is to make your own room spray! How cool is that! It’s definitely on my list for this spring! You can control how strong you want the scent to be, what your favorite blend might be, and just imagine the possibilities! Once you come up with a winning combination, you can make cute little spray bottles and pass them on to family and friends so they, too, can feel like spring really is in the air. Of their own homes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Spring towards a brand-new scent.

The prize goes to the most creative, most spirit or just the one you didn’t see coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>Cocktail Contest</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the contest idea? Get participants to make their best the cuff Irish and St. Patrick Day-themed cocktails, and may the best one win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go on a street crawl</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If none of the above fit your Irish appetite or you rather keep to yourself, try celebrating by going on your street crawl. Make sure you throw on some green to avoid getting pinched and embark on your own St Patrick&#8217;s day adventure. Try taking a walk through the city where St Patrick&#8217;s day is in full swing, and enjoy watching the city turn green!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>St. Patricks Day the Self Care Way; Keep Calm and Celebrate St Patrick!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rather stay in and keep calm this St Patricks day but still want to stay in the holiday spirit, try indulging in some St Patrick day themed self-care. Start by brewing yourself an Irish coffee, run a bath with a goat’s milk soak and green-themed oils like peppermint, and let the stress melt away to the sounds of relaxing Irish music.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hangover the Irish Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While St Patrick’s Day is a nationally beloved holiday, it is not exactly a nationally absorbed holiday in the way of anyone having the day off. Unlike New Year’s Eve, where we all have a national hangover day on January 1st (and most places on the 2nd too), not too many places close on St. Patricks Day. If you find yourself hungover and have to go to work this St. Patricks Day, try one of these Irish remedies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"941\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sp3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7534\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3.jpg 941w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Full Irish Breakfast<br>-Bacon<br>-Eggs<br>-Sausages<br>-Black Pudding<br>-Beans<br>-Fried Tomatoes</li><li>Irish Coffee<br>The best cure to a hangover for many the next day is the good old classic coffee.

I spend much of my free time walking our city sites, river walks and downtown sidewalks with my trusty pup, soaking in the unique history, architecture and culture Winnipeg has to offer.","url":"https://livingat300main.ca/author/jbell/"}]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7525"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/users/25"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=7525"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7525/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7536,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7525/revisions/7536"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media/7535"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=7525"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=7525"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=7525"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":7465,"date":"2022-03-03T19:02:46","date_gmt":"2022-03-03T19:02:46","guid":{"rendered":"https://livingat300main.ca/?p=7465"},"modified":"2022-03-03T19:02:49","modified_gmt":"2022-03-03T19:02:49","slug":"benefits-of-living-in-a-central-location","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"/benefits-of-living-in-a-central-location/","title":{"rendered":"Benefits of Living in a Central Location"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7473\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/office-worker-active-and-healthy-lifestyle-in-urb-2021-09-02-07-21-01-utc-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people believe that downtown living is about rigid, concrete walls and tall buildings.

Having an organized space helps get all that stuff out of the way while <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/why-an-organized-home-aids-relaxation-3144742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">improving your mental health</a>. Maximizing space becomes an even more important feature in an apartment setting if you lack in-building storage or live with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tackling the mess can be overwhelming. The key to getting it done is starting small and applying the same principles to each space as you go along. There really can be a method to the madness! Here are a few tips to keep your area organized, starting in a more inconspicuous part of your house – your linen closet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to keeping any space clean is to purge. According to <a href=\"https://www.organizedinteriors.com/blog/home-organization-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">research</a>, we only use about 20% of the things we own. So what happens to the other 80%? It is probably in a storage unit or the back of a closet if you&#8217;re like me. We all do it. You know the shirt in the back that you wore once to the festival you never went to again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, your linen closet is probably hiding secrets of a past self, saying, &#8220;one day I will &lt;insert idea here&gt;.&#8221; Purging will give you the space to evaluate what is essential and what to dump. The cup of buttons I found in the back of my linen closet quickly became an art project. Get crafty with things you can&#8217;t bring yourself to throw out. Another option is to recycle what is still usable for someone else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try looking up places in your city that will recycle odds and ends. Small appliances, electronics, and old smoke alarms can go to local <a href=\"https://greendeal.ca/recycling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">green recycling depots</a>. So, grab a couple of bins and start throwing things over your shoulder like a 90s cartoon. Here is a tip: if you have to ask, &#8220;what was this for again?&#8221; then it is probably not something you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NL8-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7438\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL8.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Purging is only the first step. It prepares you for the next stage of this project – sorting through what you want to keep. This is the part where you go back to grade two math and start pairing like items with like items. Put all the towels in one pile, then the lint rollers in another. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are happy with your groups, start putting things into <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/cat/clothes-boxes-10565/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closet-organizing storage bins</a> of different shapes and sizes. Storage bins help to create dedicated spaces that help control clutter. Containers with lids or stackable bins also help to create more vertical space in your closet and more room to play with. Having dedicated compartments for specific things also helps with the visual appeal of the closet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give the illusion of organization even if the bin is just stray pins and random items. That said, I like a bin-in-bin situation where each of my small-item buckets contains several other open top-boxes for things like clothespins and laundry bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to storage boxes, try out some space-saving bags, hooks, and shelves to maximize space while reducing mess. Wire shelving again helps with creating vertical space on your shelves. I like to roll my linens to help with organization. With tall and deep closet shelves, this means that I can have towels underneath the wire shelf and face towels on top (organized by color, of course). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vertical space is essential if you have a multi-person home or do not have a lot of storage space. You can also test out vacuum seal bags to give you even more room. Finally, wall hooks and Velcro strips allow you to hang things on the back of the door or the sidewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NL7-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7437\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/NL7-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn&#8217;t enough to only have the bins in place. If you want to stay organized and keep everyone at home in the loop, it is important to label everything. Many storage bins will come with label space that will help keep your space organized. If that doesn&#8217;t work, a bit of painter&#8217;s tape and a sharpie can do the trick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labeling your boxes ensures that you won&#8217;t have to open each box to find it when you are looking for something. In addition to labels, I also like having dedicated shelves. Knowing that towels are always on the top and detergent is on the bottom helps maintain your new organizing system and creates habits that anyone can follow. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how you choose to organize your space, take it slow, grab a glass of wine, and enjoy the process.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spending more time at home has probably meant that you have had more time to rethink your space.

Are you thinking about setting resolutions for 2022? With all the lockdown and pandemic talk (still) happening, this might be more difficult than in previous years. Are the gyms going to close again? Will I be able to start that new food lifestyle? Will I even be able to make it to Tulum this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we all wait for that &#8220;new normal,&#8221; we have the opportunity to reframe how we experience where we are now. For me, 2021 presented me with the chance to rethink resolutions. I decided to focus on building in more holistic practices rather than individual goals. I swapped out &#8220;gym three times a week&#8221; with &#8220;move daily.&#8221; Building better habits into day-to-day activities allowed me to actually hold to my new year&#8217;s resolutions. Because of this, I have been happier and healthier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7342\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1.jpg 1625w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are five resolutions worth keeping and implementing into your daily life. There are a few things to remember when setting any resolutions. First, set a limit on how many goals you are looking to make. Next, make your resolutions specific. When I changed my resolution to moving daily, I also made sure to add for a minimum of 15 min a day. For all you fitness buffs, I know 15 min is about half of the recommended movement time, but the pandemic was hard and, I sat a lot. This brings me to the next point, start small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few of us can successfully go from 0 to 100 overnight. By the end of 2021, I was moving for over an hour a day, but I started at 15 minutes. Finally, stay open and get help. Having an accountability partner (or app) helps hold you to your goals. The extra support is helpful when those resolutions start to feel hard. Change can be challenging. Having someone to support you through change is an important aspect of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few resolutions to help you along your journey in 2022. Good luck, you&#8217;ve got this! &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Move</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, this is not a traditional resolution of going to the gym three times a week. This resolution is just about moving your body, even if it is up and down the hallways a couple of times. The past few years have been passed sitting in a chair sitting for many people. It&#8217;s time to get active again. The physical and mental benefits of activity of any type are important, but how we get the activity is less important.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b3-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7337\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1.jpg 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad always parks in the furthest spot at the store so he can get his steps in. I prefer a dance party in the living room. It doesn&#8217;t always have to be treadmills and barbells. The key to this resolution is to commit to moving your body regularly simply. Let the type of movement you are doing evolve as you get stronger and keep going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pay it forward</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This resolution is all about finding space to give back. The pandemic has been draining for many people. Some of us have experienced it much worse than others. I know that every canceled holiday plan has been exhausting for me. This is why acts of kindness need to be built into your new year. Think about those videos of people buying meals for someone they have never met or pets howling, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b4-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7338\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1.jpg 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those little moments where you want to say, &#8220;aww, that&#8217;s so sweet.&#8221; Try building in a giving practice into your new year. We need more kind moments to continue through the pandemic. Try leaving a note (or text) for someone you know has been having a hard time. Donate to or volunteer for a local organization. Or call your mom. Whatever it is, everyone could use an act of kindness in their lives. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do one green thing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global warming is real. The abnormally hot summers say so. This year, commit to being a bit more green. This doesn&#8217;t mean you immediately have to become a master composter. It means trying out high-efficiency bulbs and recycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b5-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7339\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2.jpg 1750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or it could mean walking to the store (and getting in movement minutes). I am working on switching out cleaning products to eco-friendly products. I also used last year to start a garden. This resolution is about finding a way to get a bit greener.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start a mindfulness practice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness practices are not new. There are traditions dating back thousands of years. This is why I can bet there is something out there that would work for every person. There is enough diversity in practices to create something that feels true for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b6-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7340\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1.jpg 1479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of mindfulness are endless – stress relief, better sleep, improved mental, physical, and social health, to name a few. For some, diving into a yogic lifestyle and meditation is the way to go. For others, the namastes and cross-legged poses aren&#8217;t a fit. Mindfulness is really about slowing down and experiencing every moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many apps and sites where you can get the how-tos of developing a practice but again, start small. Maybe starting practice for you this year means breathing deeply three times when you feel mad, anxious, or overly excited. For others, mindfulness this year could mean cutting out multi-tasking and focussing in on one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try something new</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use this year as an opportunity to check something off your bucket list. With businesses reopening and a growing number of online classes from around the world, now is a great chance to learn that new skill. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7341\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this your mental workout.

Houses covered with snow, the Christmas feeling, and the chilly weather make this season magical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also the coziest of the season. The cold push us back home, and there’s a unique vibe when drinking a warm cup of coffee in the comfort of your winter-decorated home. If you didn’t have time or energy to make your home your winter wonderland and are feeling overwhelmed, I’ve curated a few -easy- tips to make your home décor a little more winter-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7220\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Light, Scent, and set the Mood with Candles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing sets more a cozier mood than candles. Used all year long, your candle’s size, shape, and smell vary depending on your taste. However, the idea is to use it to highlight those winter prime spaces, like fireplaces, mantels, and shelves, to make your apartment or house even cozier. Keep the colors on the light and bright side for a minimalist look. Scents like peppermint, pine, and apple are great options to fill your home with the perfect winter vibe. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7221\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make a wreath</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The front door is the first impression of your home. So why leave it out of the décor plan? The good thing about wreaths is that many options for inexpensive DIYs are available, so there are no excuses not to give them a try. &nbsp;Experiment with different materials like grapevine, Styrofoam, pinecones, or even cardboard. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7222\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Throw a blanket</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! It’s that time of the year where we are so proud of our chunky knit blanket. If you don’t have the chunky one, any type will do it. Throw it on your sofa, stool, or bed. The blanket will add a touch of winter décor to your space with an inexpensive, warming, and elegant result.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7223\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowers, plants, and greenery</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t wait for the Spring to enjoy your pretty flowers. Many flowers and plants survive and even thrive during winter’s cold weather<a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/amazing-houseplants-that-will-survive-the-cold-weather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">. <strong>A few days ago, we posted the best houseplants to survive the winter</strong></a>, but now we invite you to give it a try and decorate your home with flowers, foliage, or plants that will brighten up the cold season. To create a cozier look, choose earthier or white colors for flowers. Another good idea is to create a winter arrangement with bright foliage, branches, and berries.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7224\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Table décor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter, especially the holiday season, is a perfect time to celebrate with family and friends. Whether you are throwing a Christmas party or simply adding beauty to your dining room, there are many ways to style your table. From centerpieces made of greenery, candles, and pinecones to simple ideas like napkin arrangements or DIY paper houses, your table décor is a must to give a stylish feel to your winter wonderland.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7225\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bring the Outdoors in</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun idea to give your house a wintery feeling is to bring outdoor elements inside. Rocks, firewood, pinecones, and leaves can create a cozier environment and add a cabin vibe to your favorite space. Keeping firewood displayed or winter greenery in ceramic vases adds another layer of natural textures to even the most urban of the homes.   </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter is just around the corner, and this is the most beautiful season for many winter-lovers.

The rich nuttiness of the oats with some milk and a bit of brown sugar are undefeated against a cold winter morning. A slow cooker is best for cooking steel-cut oats that are a bit denser and can keep the chewiness after being cooked over a long period. On average, you will want to use 3 ½ to 4 cups of liquid for every one cup of oats depending on the size of your cooker and your desired texture.  For the liquid, you can use water or any of your favorite kinds of milk. I prefer a mix of almond milk and coconut milk. After that, it is just choosing your toppings! From classics like pecans and raisins to items like carrot and coconut chips, oatmeal allows you to mix and match to your heart&#8217;s content. Don’t forget to throw in a sweetener of choice and a few herbs or spices like cardamom or nutmeg. Get creative and try something new. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.ihearteating.com/overnight-crock-pot-carrot-cake-oatmeal/\">overnight slow cooker carrot cake oatmeal</a> recipe by Kate Dean from I Heart Eating and try a little dessert for breakfast this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beans will make you dance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID brought on a lot of changes for everyone. For me, given the extra time I had at home, I decided to transition into a vegetarian lifestyle. What this meant was experimenting with new recipes and very often, beans. Cue the slow cooker. Over the last year, I have tried a variety of slow cooker bean dishes from chili to stew. Now, when I think about a go-to slow cooker meal, I immediately think of a warm chickpea coconut curry! This dish is a staple in my meal plan, popping up every couple of months. The rich curry flavor always transports me to another, much warmer, place, and in the dead of winter, that is where I want to be. Served on a bed of rice or with a side of naan bread, this dish is all comfort. I often pair mine with some garlic roasted green beans or oven-roasted broccoli. To get your curry on, pick up some potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, ginger, and coconut milk. Again, thanks to the one-pot meal idea, all you have to do is prep the veggies and dump them all into the pot.

But did you know that your slow cooker can also make a variety of desserts and types of bread? That’s right, brownies, focaccia, French toast, and cakes can all be prepared in a slow cooker. As a big fan of dessert, slow cooker puddings and pies have been an exciting new way to cook some of my favorite sweets. I find that cooking with a slow cooker means that burning my baking is much less likely thanks to the slow cooking time. I also love that using the slow cooker frees up the oven for other tasks, which comes in handy during the busy Christmas baking season. Making dessert in a slow cooker is a bit more involved than a one-pot meal. You still need to prep the ingredients outside of the pot as you normally would, but then you can stick it into the pot to cook.

While I often choose a cup of tea, sometimes I like to change things up. Hot toddies mulled wines, and boozy hot chocolates are all beverages that help warm me up while I wind down. These are also all drinks that can easily be prepared in a slow cooker! I mix mine at lunch which guarantees an after-dinner serving time that is still hot out the pot. With slow cooker beverages, we can return to the one-pot meal idea and get creative with mix-ins. Want to try a mint hot chocolate, or ginger-spiced mulled wine? You can easily adapt any base recipe with your favorite flavors. Just stay open to the possibilities and adjust along the way.

But to create that real winter hygge (a Danish word meaning a quality of coziness and comfort that creates a feeling of contentment or well-being according to dictionary.com) you need to set the scene. While your slow cooker can make food items, it can also make candles, lotion bars, and soaps! That’s right, you can set the scene for your winter wonderland with these DIY household items. When creating a non-food product in your cooker, you will want to be sure to use a liner where possible to avoid cross-contamination and for easy clean-up. These are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased online or from the kitchen aisle in your local grocery store. I love candle-making. They make great gifts, are pretty easy to make, and they smell great! Soaps and lotion bars are also great gift ideas and allow you to exercise your creative side.
