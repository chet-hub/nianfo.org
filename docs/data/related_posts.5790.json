Manitoba summers bring beautiful weather, and there is no shortage of things to do outside while soaking up the sun and staying active. With scenic architecture, beautiful trails, green parks, and tons of events, downtown is full things to see while you stay active this summer.</p>\n<h3>Follow the Riverwalk</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about downtown is the <a href=\"https://www.travelmanitoba.com/listings/the-forks-historic-port-and-riverwalk/6764/\">riverwalk</a>. Winnipeg is famous for the <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/river-trail\">skating trail</a> in the winter, which is among the longest in Canada, but you don’t need to wait for the ice to freeze to enjoy the sights. The river trail is a beautiful, accessible path that winds alongside our river. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the path as it stretches through <a href=\"https://www.osbornevillage.com/\">Osborne Village</a> and surrounds The Forks. It’s a gorgeous choice for a weekend stroll, and practical enough for your daily commute!</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9Mei2jg8C/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Sit down dining not really your thing? Check out downtown <a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/eat-and-drink/peg-city-grub/read,post/881/2019-winnipeg-food-truck-guide\">Winnipeg’s many food trucks</a> this summer! With a surprising amount of variety and high-quality dishes, it’ll make you rethink street food. Don’t forget to check back at the end of summer for the <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/events/food-truck-wars/\">Manyfest</a> (Food Truck Wars). This year’s competition runs from September 6 to 8, which is arguably the end of the food truck season for Winnipeg.</p>\n<h3>Soak up the Arts in the Exchange District</h3>\n<p><strong>Reggae Fest</strong><br />\nIn July, Winnipeg hosts the Winnipeg <a href=\"https://srfwpg.blogspot.com/\">Soca Reggae Festival</a>. This is one for your summer to-do list for sure! Catch the festival downtown at Winnipeg favourite, <a href=\"https://exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/\">The Cube Stage</a>.

Between the throbbing nightclubs and laid-back bars, you’re bound to have a great time anywhere you go. In a city so full of live music and things to do, it can be hard to choose where to go⁠—but The Good Will Social Club and Forth Café are two of my favourites.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://thegoodwill.ca/\">The Good Will Social Club</a></h3>\n<p>The Good Will is located at 625 Portage Avenue, near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. At first glance, it looks like an okay option to stop for a beer, and you’d be right⁠—but it’s so much more than that! The Good Will often features DJs, bands, and karaoke. Once upon a time, I took part in a spelling “beer” there! Check out their online calendar to see what they’ve got going on.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">Forth Café</a></h3>\n<p>During the day this charming café at 171 McDermot Avenue is a great place for coffee and cocktails. However, this café has a not-so-secret secret: an intimate bar downstairs and a roof-top patio with views of the Exchange. The café closes at 10:00 pm during the week, but the bar and roof-top patio are <a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">open late</a>.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwR7W2UAyqU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Professionally I started out freelancing Social Media Services, Marketing, Content Writing, Design, and am in the midst of my freelance hobbies being turned into a full fledge start-up. Personally, I love to explore, learn and create. I enjoy studying and practice with energy &amp; holistic healing methods such as Aromatherapy, Reiki and Hypnotherapy. I spend much of my free time walking our city sites, river walks and downtown sidewalks with my trusty pup, soaking in the unique history, architecture and culture Winnipeg has to offer.","url":"https://livingat300main.ca/author/jbell/"}]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/5790"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/users/25"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=5790"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/5790/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5800,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/5790/revisions/5800"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media/5793"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=5790"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=5790"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=5790"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"related_posts":[{"slug":"hidden-fashion-boutiques-downtown-and-in-the-exchange","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC01195-2.png","date":"2018-10-28T11:00:54","categories":[{"name":"Fashion","link":"/category/fashion/"},{"name":"Shopping","link":"/category/shopping/"}],"title":"Hidden Fashion Boutiques—Downtown and in the Exchange"},{"slug":"a-composting-guide-for-apartment-living","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/neslihan-gunaydin-3493-unsplash-1024x683.jpg","date":"2018-10-30T20:31:24","categories":[{"name":"Apartment","link":"/category/apartment/"},{"name":"Environment","link":"/category/environment/"},{"name":"Lifestyle","link":"/category/lifestyle/"}],"title":"A Composting Guide for Apartment Living"},{"slug":"decorating-an-apartment-with-downtown-spirit-and-style","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dane-deaner-272375-unsplash-1370x1713-1.jpg","date":"2018-10-31T20:54:10","categories":[{"name":"Apartment","link":"/category/apartment/"},{"name":"Lifestyle","link":"/category/lifestyle/"}],"title":"Decorating an Apartment with Downtown Spirit and Style"},{"slug":"merry-christmas-from-300-main","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snapshot-1-1024x576.png","date":"2018-12-20T11:00:26","categories":[{"name":"300 Main","link":"/category/300-main/"}],"title":"Merry Christmas from 300 Main"},{"slug":"surviving-the-roommate-experience","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/adult-apartment-carpet-1054974.jpg","date":"2019-01-24T11:00:15","categories":[{"name":"Apartment","link":"/category/apartment/"},{"name":"Culture","link":"/category/culture/"},{"name":"Environment","link":"/category/environment/"},{"name":"Lifestyle","link":"/category/lifestyle/"},{"name":"Relationships","link":"/category/relationships/"}],"title":"Surviving the Roommate Experience"},{"slug":"valentines-day-in-winnipegs-heart","image_url":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02-1024x683.jpg","date":"2019-02-13T17:24:06","categories":[{"name":"Downtown Events","link":"/category/downtown-events/"},{"name":"Food &amp;
