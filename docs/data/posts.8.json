It takes a welcoming environment, friendly staff and home-cooked food with restaurant-quality taste to deliver a great dining experience. <a href=\"https://www.thedonrestaurantwinnipeg.com/\">The Don</a> tops my list by delivering all of that, with solid <a href=\"https://www.thedonrestaurantwinnipeg.com/menu-breakfast\">breakfast options</a> ranging from $5 to $10.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5765\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast place in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Breakfast, Breakfast place in downtown Winnipeg, downtown winnipeg living, living in downtown winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/IMG_4450-2-1400x1050.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/IMG_4450-2.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>One of the best things about living downtown is being able to take a short walk, bike or drive to a fresh sit-down breakfast.

The diner itself is large, but has a cozy, welcoming atmosphere. Served by friendly and personable staff, the food really shines. With a good variety to choose from—including smoothies and reasonably-priced <a href=\"https://www.thedonrestaurantwinnipeg.com/menu-features\">breakfast specials</a>—there’s something on the menu for <em>everyone</em> (why hello there, potato dill pancakes!). Each dish has a home-cooked feel and tastes delicious; you can even sub perogies for hash browns. Try it out, and you might find yourself becoming a regular!</p>\n<h3>Work or Play, A Great Start Either Way</h3>\n<p>The Don delivers the best breakfast in Winnipeg, thanks to its wonderful staff, scrumptious food, and affordable menu.

The project’s ambitions were to connect local gardeners and to help new relationships “blossom”.</p>\n<p>When I first saw the piece, I was in awe of Erica’s ability to create something that felt so familiar. Living rooms are places of comfort, where we gather with friends and family; they’re filled with memories of holidays, parties and cuddling up to watch your favourite tv shows. Building something that feels so homey encourages people to feel welcomed.

So tiny that guests will walk through it and ask, “Where’s the rest of it?” But I don’t let the size of my kitchen make me shy away from cooking! I’m a foodie, but most importantly, a foodie on a budget—so I cook most of my meals at home.</p>\n<h3><em>Why I Love Cooking</em></h3>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve fallen in love with cooking. I walk into my kitchen and the possibilities feel endless! My favourite way to cook is with no plan or recipe. In the kitchen there are no rules, and I love that. In school, work, and even my hobbies I always feel pressure to be creative in a certain way; but cooking is a different kind of creativity, and I can create without limitations!</p>\n<p>And because I love cooking so much, I don’t let my small kitchen prevent me from cooking up a storm. Here are some of my favourite ways to use my space!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5630\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Small kitchen, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments, Kitchen Interiors, Kitchen Clutter, Kitchen utensils\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/hanging-kitchen-kitchen-utensils-211760-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>1. Stacking</h3>\n<p>Stacking is your best friend with a tiny kitchen. My kitchen is what some might call an organized mess. As soon as you walk into my space, you’re greeted by my microwave underneath my coffee maker, which is tucked up against my slow cooker, which has three cookbooks stacked neatly on top. Small kitchens usually don’t have room for much horizontal space, but what about vertical space? Start by stacking items that you don’t tend to grab as much, and then stack items that you frequently use together. Not only will you save space, but you’ll also know which stack to pull things from when you’re in a time crunch rather than running around trying to find your food processer or a cookbook.</p>\n<h3>2. Clean as You Go</h3>\n<p>Cleaning as you go is a crucial habit for cooking in a small space. You cannot use your space to its fullest potential with pots and food scrapes taking over half of your counter space! This tip is basic, but a total game changer.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1497982703677591&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"573\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3>3. Use ALL Your Space</h3>\n<p>Utilizing all your space is also a key component to enlarging your kitchen. Try placing a cutting board over your stove top or an open drawer. Use your kitchen table as a prep space or place one of your larger cutting boards over your sink to make extra counter space. Get creative. Just because it isn’t a countertop doesn’t mean it can’t function like one!</p>\n<h3>4. Look Up for Utensil Storage</h3>\n<p>Store your utensils up high! I’m very particular about where my utensils go. I recommend that anyone who does a lot of cooking in a small kitchen store their most used utensils, pots, and pans on hooks. If possible, a shallow cubby is a great space to store utensils. I find it very stressful to rifle through drawers in search of my whisk or a medium frying pan. By displaying a few of your most crucial cooking tools, you set yourself up for success!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1510041235805071&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"491\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><em>Kitchen Appliances I Can Vouch For</em></h3>\n<p>Every birthday and holiday, it seems like a new kitchen appliance is at the top of my list! Here are some of my favourite kitchen appliances that are a must for those of us with limited space.</p>\n<p><strong>Mini Food Processor</strong></p>\n<p>A mini food processor is an essential! Not only is this contraption small, but it’s also a great tool for chopping up food quickly. It saves you so much counter space over clunky cutting boards.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow Cooker</strong></p>\n<p>Slow cookers solve all our problems, honestly. They’re a necessity for those who dread coming home and cooking dinner after their 9-to-5. Just pop in your ingredients in the morning, leave it for the day and boom, a hot meal to welcome you home!</p>\n<p><strong>Coffee Maker</strong></p>\n<p>A good ol’ coffee maker is a must for us downtowners—it’s just a way of life! I have both a coffee maker and an espresso maker, but coffee for me is a lifestyle more than a drink. I think a standard coffee maker is a necessity for all kitchens. Nowadays, they’re so compact they don’t take up much room in your kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>Rolling Cart</strong></p>\n<p>While not exactly an appliance, a rolling cart is life-changing! I bought mine from Ikea for $35, but the amount of use I get out of it makes it priceless in my book. I mainly use it to store ingredients and utensils that I need while cooking but don’t have the counter space for. The best part is, once I am done with it I can roll it into a corner and it’s out of my way!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Got any other small kitchen tips and tricks?

It’s also known for its selection of unique, classy coffee shops. Downtown coffee shops don’t just serve espresso drinks to get you through the day; they also offer a cozy, relaxing place to unwind.</p>\n<p>I’ve explored coffee shops in downtown Winnipeg from Main Street to Broadway, proving there are many satisfying options for holding meetings, working, chatting, or just spending quality time alone with a good book. When people ask me what to do in Winnipeg or where they can grab a good cup of coffee, I say two magic words: <em>Forth</em> and <em>Parlour</em>. Of course, those are just the highlights⁠—here are five options for where to get your caffeine fix downtown.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools &amp; Horses </a></h3>\n<p>This coffee shop is located at 379 Broadway (plus another location at the Forks), and you can imagine how busy it gets. During the lunch rush, you’re lucky if you manage to snag a seat. To keep pace, the staff is very energetic and friendly. I won’t bother mentioning that they have great coffee⁠—obviously they do, or this place wouldn’t be on the list! Instead, I want to highlight the interior. My forever-favourite part about Fools and Horses is the humongous wooden table right in the middle of the shop. The table is surrounded by mint and silver iron chairs, which are usually filled with students. I can’t count how many random but totally pleasant chats I’ve while sitting there, sipping a delicious cappuccino.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffoolswpg%2Fposts%2F882303228629504&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"604\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://parlourcoffee.ca/\">Parlour</a></h3>\n<p>The first thing that literally hit my eye when I walked into tiny Parlour was the writing on the wall. <em>“No Wi-Fi. Talk to your neighbour.”</em> I was amazed to see my own philosophy of old-fashioned communication reflected in a coffee shop. That day, I got a cup of hot chocolate, a croissant, and walked out having decided to become a regular customer at 468 Main Street. The shop itself is small, but very cozy. They don’t have the usual tables and chairs, just wooden bar chairs and counters lining the walls and window. Grab a spot by the window for the best view of Main Street. Thanks to their friendly baristas, welcoming atmosphere and high-quality coffee, you’ll find an impeccable place to hide from the rain with a good book or for a chat with a stranger.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fparlourcoffee%2Fposts%2F2492837500767216%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"490\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/\">Thom Bargen</a></h3>\n<p>Thom Bargen has two locations in Winnipeg, but I love the café at 250 Kennedy Street. Thom Bargen is the only place in Winnipeg that serves <a href=\"https://philsebastian.com/\">Phil &amp; Sebastian coffee</a> beans. If you’re a coffee lover like myself, you’ll appreciate the selection Thom Bargen offers. They also feature special guest roasters that change monthly. My favourites so far have been Monogram and Anchored.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDowntownPeggy%2Fposts%2F2500409343313725&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"681\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center>Thom Bargen is also known for its beautiful tiny marble tables, and prime location in a beautiful part of downtown. The café is framed by the <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> on one side, and a small bookshop that has a huge selection of old and rare editions on the other. The Kennedy location also has the most Instagram-worthy plant wall! It makes the café feel fresh and summery on even the coldest days.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.stellas.ca/\">Stella’s</a></h3>\n<p>While not technically a coffee shop, Stella’s deserves a mention when discussing coffee in downtown Winnipeg. The Stella’s location at 110 Sherbrook is a <a href=\"https://www.stellas.ca/bakery/\">bakery</a>-plus-restaurant combo across two buildings. While I highly recommend the restaurant for breakfast or lunch, today I want to highlight the bakery. Step inside, take in a breath of air warm with freshly baked bread, order a latte and chocolate croissant, and nestle in at one of the tiny wooden tables in the corner. The bakery feels meant for quiet conversations or a quick getaway from responsibilities. A word of advice: When hunting for a chocolate croissant, make sure to get there in the morning. The famous pastries at Stella’s fly out the door as soon as they open.</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FStellascafebakery%2Fposts%2F2142578272457783%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"614\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/forth_wpg/\">Forth</a></h3>\n<p>I saved the most unique and loved café for last. Forth is known for its square wooden tables, plants, and stand of newspapers from different cities. It’s also beloved for its rooftop patio, which offers amazing views from May to October (weather permitting). You can see both the modern part of downtown and the heritage buildings of the Exchange District. The contrast is breathtaking.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5583\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_2441-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee Shops In Downtown Winnipeg, downtown Winnipeg, winnipeg cafe, winnipeg coffee shops, downtown winnipeg coffee shops, coffee shops in the exchange district, exchange district, coffee in exchange district, exchange district coffee\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_2441-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_2441-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_2441-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_2441-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_2441-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_2441-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Forth doesn’t just serve espresso drinks. They serve a small menu of snacks, salads, and some alcoholic beverages. The rooftop bar is the most stylish and minimalist-looking bar I’ve seen in Winnipeg. When you visit, indulge in the avocado toast, as it will just melt on your tongue. The shop is in a historical building at 171 McDermot. The <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/dawsonrichardsonbuilding.shtml\">Dawson Richardson Building</a> was built in 1921 to become the Grain Trade News publishing house. When inside, you might feel you can still catch the smell of old typographical papers and hear the click-clack of typewriter keys.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Let us know about your favourite downtown Winnipeg coffee shop.

Shake to mix, and then add the Sal Suds and oil. Gently shake the bottle again to combine the ingredients.</p>\n<h3>Homemade Drain Cleaner</h3>\n<p>½ cup baking soda</p>\n<p>¼ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>Sprinkle baking soda down the clogged or smelly drain, then pour in the vinegar. Let the bubbling mixture sit for an hour or so, then pour boiling hot water down the drain to rinse. Depending on how clogged the drain is, you may need to repeat the process. If you clean your drain regularly, you’ll find that one dose will keep things clear.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Now let’s move on to the bathroom!</em></strong></p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5456\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade cleaning products, natural cleaning products, cleaning products winnipeg, winnipeg apartment living, downtown winnipeg living, apartment living\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Tub and Tile Cleaner</h3>\n<p>12 ounces white vinegar</p>\n<p>12 ounces dish soap (I usually use Dawn)</p>\n<p>Heat vinegar in the microwave until hot and then pour into the spray bottle. Add the dish soap, put the lid on, gently shake and you are ready to clean!

Just hear me out!)</em></h3>\n<p>1 can Coca Cola</p>\n<p>1 cup baking soda</p>\n<p>1 cup white distilled vinegar</p>\n<p>Dump the Coca Cola into the toilet and let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then flush. Add the vinegar and the baking soda to the toilet next (without stirring or scrubbing) and wait until the mixture stops bubbling. Scrub any tough stains, otherwise just flush and you’re done! The soda and the vinegar/baking-soda mixture will also help to keep the pipes clear of buildup.</p>\n<p><em><strong>But what about carpets or stinky smells that linger around your house?</strong></em></p>\n<h3>Homemade Air Freshener</h3>\n<p>15 drops pure essential oil (grapefruit and lavender are my favourite!)</p>\n<p>½ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>½ cup water</p>\n<p>Combine ingredients in a spray bottle and shake. Spray liberally around your home to freshen things up!</p>\n<h3>Carpet Cleaner</h3>\n<p>1 cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>2 cups water 2 teaspoons salt 15 drops lavender essential oil or another clear, pure essential oil of choice</p>\n<p>Combine vinegar and water in a large spray bottle. Add in salt and lavender essential oil; close the cap and shake bottle. Spray on carpets where needed and allow carpets to air-dry.

Maybe you’re drawn in by the menu, the decor, the service, or a beautiful combination of all three. Or maybe it has that certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca/\">Smith Restaurant</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a> is one of those places.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re enjoying a staycation, a family gathering, or looking for a more intimate <em>rendezvous</em> (yes, even for breakfast), Smith Restaurant should be at the top of your list.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>Country chic. Comfortable. Warm and modern. In a nutshell, Smith’s interior is a blend of styles with something to appeal to everyone. And, given that Smith is a popular spot not only for breakfast but dinner and the after-dinner crowd as well, its appeal transcends the morning hours. Let’s call it <em>Canadiana</em> fusion, with wood features, modern lighting, leather and benches covered in <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> point blankets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5361\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5361\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast, Smith Restaurant, Inn at The Forks, The Forks, Meet Me At The Forks, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Living Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg Restaurants, Where To Eat Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside the Smith Restaurant</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>The service</h3>\n<p>Professional and yet personable fits the service to a tee. From the host, who was unfazed when we showed up early for our reservation, to our server Angela, with whom we shared a few good laughs. The service matched the situation and exceeded our expectations.</p>\n<h3>The menu</h3>\n<p>“Not your mama’s eggs” comes to mind when describing the menu. Not that there is anything wrong with her eggs, but Smith’s chefs have succeeded in creating a menu that features local, seasonal, and Canadian products, which really bumps those eggs up to the next level. Sure, you can order the Hotel Breakfast—which consists of some good old-fashioned eggs with a choice of bacon or sausage—or oatmeal (with a Saskatoon berry twist), but there are a few more interesting options.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbGNNzgKD6/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It might be the Scandinavian blood in me, but the Eggs Copenhagen called, and I was not disappointed. Two poached eggs with smoked lox and rösti potato came together nicely. Of course, no breakfast would be complete without a good cup of tea or coffee, and here, too, we pleasantly surprised.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual selection of teas, cappuccino, espresso, and Americano coffees, Smith offers a French press coffee option. We gave the French press a try, and it was exquisite.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to kick off your day with some good food, give Smith a try. Perhaps you, too, will find that it has that <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<p>Feedback on <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154954-d7078344-Reviews-Smith_Restaurant-Winnipeg_Manitoba.html\">TripAdvisor rates Smith a four out of five</a> with “value” having the lowest rating.

Classes usually run Monday to Friday from 12 to 1 pm. Visit the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/fitnessinthepark/\">Downtown Biz website</a> for details and an up-to-date schedule. These classes are free; just bring your yoga mat!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbwpg.cmha.ca/events/free-yoga-and-meditation-tuesdays-and-thursdays-2019-06-25/\"><strong>Yoga and meditation with Cian</strong></a><br />\n930 Portage Avenue</p>\n<p>Every Tuesday from 6 to 7 pm, Cian—a trained yogi—hosts a free yoga and meditation session for Winnipeggers of all levels of experience. The event is first come, first serve with only 20 spots available, so show up early to grab a spot!</p>\n<p><strong><em>My recommendation</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you’re not a fan of group classes, or just want to get your yogi on solo, downtown Winnipeg has beautiful parks where you can lay out your mat. One of my favourite quiet places is <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/business/stephen-juba-park/\">Stephen Juba Park</a>, right waterfront in the Exchange district. If you are looking for a quieter yoga session, try going early in the morning.</p>\n<h3>Where can I find a few minutes of silence?</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re looking for a peaceful place to study or somewhere quiet to relax, downtown Winnipeg has got your back!</p>\n<p><strong>Millennium Library<br />\n</strong>251 Donald Street</p>\n<p>A library is the most obvious place to look when craving a bit of silence, but the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/branchpages/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library</a> stands out among Winnipeg’s libraries. Spread on each side of a massive staircase, the study area is a designated “quiet zone.” At any point in the day, you’ll find people working in complete silence. This area is also beautiful, with simple design that won’t distract you from your work and enormous windows that stand from floor to ceiling. Natural light fills the area and it’s a wonderful place to find a few moments of peace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/leg-lib/\"><strong>Legislative Library</strong></a><br />\n200 Vaughan Street</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BjgRSZElbTB/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;
