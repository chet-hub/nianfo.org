When living in a rental property, it may seem like it isn&#8217;t much you can do if you are limited by not being able to paint or change too much. You can turn any space into the perfect bedroom with a few key tips, no matter your bedroom situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors &amp; Textures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the overall aesthetic design of your bedroom, you want to consider your colors and textures first. If you are planning to paint, make sure you choose your colors carefully and consider the color scheme of one of the next major features in the room, like your bedding or rug.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7932\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom3.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to go with<a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Ideas/Popular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> colors that complement each other</a> without being overbearing. If you already have a common color throughout the room, you might want to choose one that compliments the things you already have. You want to go with colors that are the more neutral, darker, or lighter tones than the colors you will be working with; this compliments your bright colors without using the same ones and being too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For textures, you want to be mindful that you are adding the right ones, but you want to avoid having too many. Textures include things like your rug, pillows, blankets, and patterns. These are all things that have and create their texture, and you want to make sure you choose the same or complementary and not add too many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7929\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-vlada-karpovich-5357416-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t painting, having white walls in your bedroom is a great way to trick the eye into feeling like the space is bigger than it is. If you have a smaller space, it might be better to go with white to make the space feel larger, whereas, in a small room, the wrong or too many colors can make the space feel cramped.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Having the right Frame in Mind</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to consider is your<a href=\"https://www.structube.com/en_ca/furniture/bedroom?page=1&amp;sort-by=position-asc&amp;category_id%5Bfilter%5D=Beds%2C503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> bed frame</a>. If you will be getting a new bed frame, it is essential to think about the space and what you need when choosing one. One thing you can never have enough of in a bedroom is storage space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7928\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom12.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> So if you are low on available closet space or don&#8217;t have room for dressers, then this could be a great solution for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pick the Best Nightstand</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the right bedside table makes all the difference.

The bedroom is the perfect room to use minimalism.

If you do have to have things like a desk, electronics, and your collectibles in your room, you can still use the less is more approach. Display things like trinkets and collections on floating shelves rather than taking up surface space on your dresser, desk, and side tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Room Dividers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have to have an office space in your bedroom, it is not only a useful design trick that both helps cut the visual clutter but also the mental clutter. <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/risoer-room-divider-white-black-70182191/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A room divider</a> is a helpful trick to help you focus by eliminating other distractions in your room while working on your desk without getting distracted with laundry, tv, and bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bedroom1-1024x672.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7923\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bedroom1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Room dividers are a great design tool that you can utilize when designing your room.
