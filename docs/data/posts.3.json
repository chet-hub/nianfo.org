These holiday themes are packaged and paired nicely with your food, decoration, and activity options. While Christmas is a theme of its own, changing things up will help to keep things fresh and make your party stand out. I am offering this list of party ideas to help you ramp up your holiday season as you get ready to wind down the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7268\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty1.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RWG Christmas</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, Christmas is its own theme and allows you to keep it easy by grabbing all the green, gold, white, and red you can from any of your local shops. Seven-foot self-lighting tree? Check. Popcorn tinsel? Done. An RWG Christmas (red, white, and green) gives you the chance to slide into the holiday season easily with pre-packaged décor and maybe a pine branch or two from your local coniferous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Try making your space look more festive with some traditional Christmas garnishes. Hang a stocking by the fire (or TV stand), throw up some mistletoe (for that special someone who walks through the door), and grab a couple of empty boxes to wrap and place beneath your tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: You can’t do traditional Christmas without a Christmas ham or turkey. For those looking for a vegetarian option, why not try a nut loaf as a savory alternative. For those who want to keep it simple, try one of the holiday feature meal kits from local restaurants like <a href=\"https://localpubliceatery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Local Public Eatery</a>. Pair your dinner with your favorite sides like mash potatoes, some greens, and a dinner roll (or two). Pick up a bottle of wine from <a href=\"https://www.ellementwine.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ellement</a> at the Forks. Wrap this meal up with some holiday sweets from local bakeries like <a href=\"https://tallgrassbakery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tall Grass Prairie</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xn--gtowpg-wta.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gato Bakeshop</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep friends and family entertained with an ugly sweater contest or a gingerbread house-building competition. You might just want to crack out a board game and play until the night runs dry. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7269\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tinsel and Tini</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to zhuzh things up this holiday season? Test out a Tinsel and Tini party that will give you a chance to crack out the sparkles and get a bit fancy. Think New Years&#8217; Eve at Christmas!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: While a classic pine is usually a go-to, an all-white tree will allow your Tinsel and Tinis party to shine. Dress it up with some silver and white decorations that shimmer like the snow on a sunny day. Pair this with a tinsel garland held together with a few logs of white birch and a couple of soy candles from <a href=\"https://www.coalandcanary.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Coal and Canary</a>. Tip: add in some hints of gold and pine green to tie this look together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: A Tinsel and Tini party is all about the Martinis. Test out your bartending skills with a few different options like this <a href=\"https://inspiredbycharm.com/white-christmas-martini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White Martini</a> from Inspired Charm or these <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/g2881/christmas-martinis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">holiday-inspired mixes</a> posted by Town &amp; Country. As for what to eat? Do dinner differently with a choose-your-own-adventure tapas bar. &nbsp;Keep it Christmas by throwing in some slices of turkey, a few dinner rolls, and some green and red olives. Top off the platter with some white chocolate bark or macaroons from <a href=\"https://www.caroonbymj.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caroon by MJ</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep this party focussed on the sips and dips by hosting a DIY martini bar! Throw in fondue and keep your guest full of laughs from mishaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7270\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nutcracker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s annual show, this theme allows you to tap into your artistic side and get busy with some DIY. Think sugar plum fairies, kingdoms and crowns, and a magic wand to bring it all to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: As with most of these themes, it starts with a tree, and this time, the bigger, the better. Dress your majestic coniferous in gold and wrap the base in crimson. Flank this tree with a couple of nutcracker soldiers, throw on some candy canes and add an angel on top. Hang those stockings and use a bit of extra fabric to create a luxurious garland for your “fireplace”. The key to this Christmas theme is decadence and extravagance. Make this party feel authentic by picking up a few antiques from <a href=\"https://www.thingsforrwb.com/?fbclid=IwAR0S4bGw8NmQXGkstmSPZXXLDCqKBrsirUodsSPo1lgxDmtvcWvomNqOR28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Things by RWB</a>. Remember to watch out for that Rat King though, he might try to steal all your goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Get into the theme by trying a few meat pies from local vendor <a href=\"http://www.mollysmeatpies.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Molly’s Meat Pies</a>. Pair these with some mushroom soup (my favorite is from <a href=\"https://earls.ca/locations/main-street/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Earl’s on Main Street</a>!) and a side of green beans. Grab a sip of your favorite vodka and try your hand at some homemade marzipan or sugar plums. Or you could just eat the candy canes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: What better way to get into character than by hosting a dress-up party? Have people come in their best nutcracker-inspired couture and dance the night away. You could even throw in a crown-making activity to see who really will be crowned the next Rat King!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7272\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>True North</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for something a bit more low-key? Why not think about an all-Canadian Christmas theme that screams cozy and cute with a little bit of camp? That’s right, we are talking about plaid wrapped in twine and drizzled in snowflakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Get that tree up and dress it in plaid and gold ribbons and bows. Feel free to paint the tips with a bit of white to make it look like it has just snowed. Those plaid stockings with the buck cut-out hung together with a few strings of twine would make a fine addition. If you want to get into the spirit, why not up the ante with a couple of hand-carved pieces from the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/qaumajuq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Winnipeg Art Gallery</a> in support of the new Qaumajuq gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Is it too much of a cliché to call on poutine, Bannock, and bacon, and beers? I don’t think so. Stay cozy and homey by serving up these Canadian favorites with a side of split pea soup. To end the evening, fire up the kettle and serve a round of hot toddies (maple syrup required) with a couple of butter tarts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Who can say no to a poutine station? Head down to the <a href=\"https://thecheesemongers.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cheesemongers Fromagerie</a> on Corydon and pick up some of your favorite poutine toppings. End this evening with a gift exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you choose to do, have a very happy holiday with your nearest and dearest!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can smell it in the air – the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season.

The dry air and fewer hours of light aren&#8217;t the best environments for most plants. However, some indoor household plants are best suited for even the chillier rooms. Check out the top 6 cold-tolerant plants that are sure to make your house cozier and brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Snake Plant</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plan1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7206\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Snake plant (Sansevieria) can resist low light, cool temperatures, and dry soil. This plant&#8217;s variety of colors and patterns will make your home more stylish, remove toxins, and improve air quality. For better care, during the winter, let these plants dry out between waterings</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geraniums</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7207\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant2-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Geraniums (Pelargonium) are cold-tolerant plants. The vibrant colors of its flowers will brighten your space and make it look like spring never left. Even though it is suited for chillier areas, it needs a few hours of daily sunshine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jade</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7208\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jade (Crassula Ovata) is known for gracefully tolerating winter and summer. This thick-leaves plant, like the Geranium, needs light to survive. Well-drained soil is essential for Jade, and you should consider watering it once every two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maidenhair Fern</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7209\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Need a plant that will thrive in a low-light environment? Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum) is your choice. This plant can survive with indirect light, but it&#8217;s essential to keep the soil humid, so it must be watered consistently and frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Succulents</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7210\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With many colors, patterns, and styles to choose from, succulents are probably the easiest indoor plants to take care of.  Succulents will survive dry, cold environments and are a good option if you like to leave your plants on your windowsill. You can create a succulent terrarium, mixing and matching the different styles of these incredible and resilient plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fiddle Leaf </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7211\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While certain plants grow during the winter, that is not the case with Fiddle Leaf (Ficus Lirata). Because of that, you need to adjust the watering for the cold season, reducing the plant&#8217;s watering to once every month if the room isn&#8217;t too humid. This plant likes consistent sunlight, so it is recommended to place it in a south-facing window.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For Winnipeggers, keeping the greenery in their homes throughout the cold months of winter can seem challenging.

You gotta love ‘em! Whether they’re fuzzy, feathery, or scaly, having animals makes a home happier. Mine recently became a three-cat household, and there’s always enough drama, excitement, and heartwarming cuteness to make every day an adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re thinking of adding a few paws, claws, or fins to your family, I urge you to consider making your adoption from one of the many local shelters and rescues. Providing a “furever” home for an animal in need will give you warm fuzzies inside <em>and </em>out &#8211; because pets are snuggly, <em>and</em> you’re supplying a loving environment to a creature who wouldn’t have one otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Before you adopt</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot to consider when choosing a pet. Before you get sucked in by all the adorable faces at your local rescue, assess your lifestyle and needs so you can find the “purrfect” pet for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to think about stuff like:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Space</strong> &#8211; your living space, specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do you rent or own?</strong> Check your leasing agreement to ensure a pet is allowed!</li><li><strong>Do you have room for activities?</strong> If you have a 500 square foot bachelor suite, a Great Dane probably isn’t for you.</li><li><strong>What about floor space?</strong> They’ll need a bed, bathroom, food, and toys. You’re making room for them in your life emotionally <em>and </em>physically.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finances</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Have you budgeted for ongoing costs?</strong> Your new pet needs food, litter, toys, treats, and regular vaccinations and check-ups even after the initial adoption fees. Make sure you’re OK to set aside some of your monthly scratches to take care of your pet.</li><li><strong>What about emergencies?</strong> If Fido swallows a priceless action figure or scarfs down the pan of brownies you left on the counter, you will need to make an emergency trip to the vet! These forays are usually <em>expensive</em>. Whether you stash away a chunk of that monthly pet budget into an emergency fund or have a spare credit card ready to go, make sure to have a plan in place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-1024x740.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7148\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-300x217.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-770x557.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-293x212.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-500x362.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498.jpg 1195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How often are you at home? </strong>Whether you’re home all day or gone in 10-hour stretches is a major factor in what kind of pet you should get. Training a new puppy requires constant vigilance, whereas a mature animal is better suited to spend time alone.</li><li><strong>How much time are you prepared to spend with them? </strong>All pets need quality time with their owners to establish and maintain a bond, just like any relationship. However, some animals are more independent, and others will hound you for attention. Assess how much time you can allocate to walking, grooming, feeding, playing, training, and petting, and adjust accordingly.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Energy level</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How active are you?</strong> Getting up to walk the dog in the morning is a good motivator, but it might also be something you regret committing to. Or, if you want a buddy to go with you on runs, somebody who wants to lie by the fire all day is not for you.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All animals require an investment of time and energy. What varies is how much. Even the most independent of animals need attention and care. So before you scurry off to the pound, take a moment’s “paws” to deliberate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adopt On!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re looking for a dog, cat, rabbit, guinea pig, or something more exotic, there are many local shelters you could choose to adopt from, such as D’Arcy’s Arc, Winnipeg Pet Rescue, Craig Street Cats, or the Winnipeg Humane Society.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7149\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Multiple visits <em>are</em> necessary</strong>. Chant this mantra to protect yourself against the impending cuteness. It’s hard not to come home with <em>all </em>the animals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shop around</strong> &#8211; don’t settle on the first pair of adorable eyes you see. When you do find an animal you connect with, you will know. When you find an animal you love, it’s ruff not to take them home immediately. But, a pet shouldn’t be an impulse decision. Many shelters will allow you to put a hold or deposit on the animal you’d like to adopt. Do this and sleep on the decision. If you still feel the same way in the morning, it might be time to take that chance. If you find yourself second-guessing, you may want to re-assess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Age and personality </strong>are much more relevant than an animal’s breed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider adopting an adult animal if you can. A new puppy or kitten is tempting, but they are a <em>lot </em>more work. Mature animals are more likely to be overlooked at shelters, but they’re often much more aware and grateful when they do get taken home. Plus, if they’re already potty trained, that’s a huge bonus!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get to know them by spending time with them at the shelter and talking with the staff who work with them daily to get a feel for the animal’s personality. Are they adventurous and playful? Social or stand-offish? How do they react to new people or interact with other animals? One isn’t necessarily better than the other, but think about what traits suit you best.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"7150\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369.jpg\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=7150\" class=\"wp-image-7150\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve decided on your new friend, bully for you! Be sure to get a full rundown of the <strong>health and history of the animal </strong>before signing the paperwork. Find out what shots they’ve had or still need, and if they’re already spayed or neutered, or if that’s something you need to arrange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you welcome them home, prepare a dedicated space in a separate room of your place so they can be introduced to the rest of the residents slowly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Homeward Bound!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>safe place </strong>is the first thing they need. New environments are scary for anyone! Of course, you’re eager to snuggle and play with your new roommate, but it’s important to remember it can take some time for your pet to adjust to its new home. Some agencies will even send along a blanket or something with a familiar scent that you can add to their setup for a bit of extra comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Establishing a routine</strong> is the best thing you can do to settle them in. The more they know what to expect on a day-to-day basis, the more comfortable they’ll be. Try to do things like feeding around the exact times every day. Keep going through the motions of a typical day, and eventually, they’ll begin to fall into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7151\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1.jpg 1555w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spending quality time with them</strong> during this initial settling-in stage is incredibly important. You’re trying to establish a new friend! Make sure to spend time talking to them, playing with them, and even just hanging out with them. If they’re shy or nervous, sitting quietly in the same space and doing something relaxed like reading a book or watching tv can help them get used to you being around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Treats </strong>are a great tool for enforcing good behaviors and easing separation anxiety. A treat when your pup lets you know he needs to pee or when the kitty tries out the designated scratching post will push their behavior in the right direction. And they’re not so worried when you leave if they get snacks when you do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have patience!</strong> Some animals will take to everything right away, while some may take a few days. My venerable Tiamat hates moving (who doesn’t!?) and will slink around warily for days until she knows every corner has been properly vetted. When we brought our newest one home, he was out galloping around with his new friend within the hour. Some animals may take weeks or even months to adjust fully, so be patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re “fur-tunate” enough to welcome an animal into your family, you will have made a “pawsitive” difference in both of your lives. You will always be the person who changed their lives for the better. And it’s such a joy to see them run to welcome you home, playing happily or sleeping comfortably in the sun. By choosing to rescue an animal, you free up space for the shelter to help more animals, <em>and</em> you give that animal a loving home. So hop to it and flock to your nearest rescue or shelter.

The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks is already a beloved Winnipeg Spot, a hot spot for activities, shows, tours, and history. With many new exciting additions, even if you&#8217;re already local to The Forks, you&#8217;ll want to plan a trip there for sure. With new one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants, and even a new arcade, this old favourite feels like a new one! Relax outside or get some work done with a local craft beer from one of the great indoor or outdoor bars and lounge areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Get To Know Downtown Winnipeg&#8217;s Art, Culture, and History with a Tour!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is famous for its beautiful historic murals, sculptures, and various other forms of art throughout its streets.

The Trolly has been a tourist staple of downtown Winnipeg for many years already. With in-depth city tours and bookable ghost tours, they are definitely worth the ride! Prefer an indoor tour? Many of Downtown&#8217;s museums offer free or affordable admission. The WAG does free exhibits and days (selected dates), as well as a discounted rate on the first Wednesday of the month for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. But there are many other museums Downtown you can check out that offer cheap or free admission, such as the Winnipeg Police Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Events</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is full of exciting activities all season long! Enjoy things like yoga and fitness in the park, movies, concerts, and more!

Take a Downtown Patio Crawl</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy a stroll downtown and some of Winnipeg&#8217;s best food and patios on a Downtown patio crawl. One of the best things about being in Downtown Winnipeg is everything is relatively close to each other, including Winnipeg&#8217;s best patio spots!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t be doing a downtown patio crawl without stopping in at Winnipeg&#8217;s already favorite spot, The Forks! With two new bars, one indoor and one outdoor, an extended licensed patio seating area, and not to mention tons of delicious restaurants to pick up some fantastic food at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Roca</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closely connecting the next few stops on Smith Street is La Roca. They are known for their impressive selection of tequila, delicious Mexican cuisine, and good patio right in the heart of downtown Winnipeg!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tavern United Roof-Top</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Downtown Tavern United (<em>aka roof-top-tav</em>) has a nice rooftop patio and bar that gives you an exciting view of Downtown!

It is a great time full of crisp excellent weather, beautiful fall scenery, and best of all, the fact that Halloween is hiding right around the corner! With this haunted holiday creeping closer it is no doubt that people are very eager to get out and get spooky! With so many fun events to celebrate the season popping up, there are lots of ways to get the heebie-jeebies! While all these events are amazing, pet owners don&#8217;t want their dogs to miss out by having to leave them at home. Like every holiday, pet owners want to enjoy this time of year with the company of their canine companions to enjoy the haunted times and beautiful weather together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first thought, it may not seem like Halloween would be the best time to be bringing your dog with you. On second thought, it is the best idea! There are plenty of ways to have a haunted Halloween with your pup, even with the conditions of 2021. If you have been wondering if there is anything you can do with your dog this Halloween season, we have you covered. Check out this list of 7 pet-friendly ways to celebrate Halloween this year!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dog1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7091\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Trick-<em>and</em>-Treat</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trick and Treating is a tasty (for your dog anyway) and fun (for you both) way to kick of the Halloween season! They say that you can&#8217;t teach an old dog new tricks, but I beg to differ. It is never too late to teach any age dog, any trick! With a little bit of encouragement and the right motivation, they&#8217;ll have it in no time. Get into the spirit with your dog by trick-<em>and</em>-treat training. Look up some tasty treats (preferably that use up all that delicious excess pumpkin from your pumpkin carving), make your pet some haunted Halloween-themed treats, and teach them some spooky new tricks. There are many easy-to-make Halloween-themed dog treat recipes out there for you to make for your pup&#8217;s trick and treat training! There are many upsides to making your dog treats too. You know and control what is in them and the portion. Home-made treats are a healthier alternative to store-bought, especially when it comes to training sessions where your lucky dog is sure to reap consecutive treat rewards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you&#8217;re finding the perfect recipe, you can also find countless Halloween themed tricks out there you can teach your dog as well. Alternatively, it is just as easy for you to modify their favorites with a creepy spin. Try starting with easier tricks they might already know like &#8220;Find The Bones&#8221; (or any other Halloween-inspired command works). The idea is to hide a prop bone, hand, skeleton, whatever is going to work with your dog, and train them to go to it when you ask them to &#8220;Find the Bones.&#8221; Most dogs already know some version of &#8220;find me your or where is your toy&#8221; and will pick this up quickly. Another great set of tricks that is also really easy to teach and for your dog to learn is Play Dead &amp; Rise From The Dead. Playing dead is already an easy classic to teach your dog, or that you might have already. Try giving it a creepy spin by adding &#8220;Rise From the Dead&#8221; or &#8220;Resurrect&#8221; as a command for your dog to get back up, after playing dead! Your ol&#8217; dog&#8217;s new tricks are sure to surprise you, and your baking skills may pleasantly surprise you both. One thing to remember is if you are using new toys, decorations, props, and ingredients, make sure that they are safe for your pet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Do a Photoshoot!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is fun any time of the year, or day for that matter to take pictures of our pets, isn&#8217;t it? There is something fun and exciting in the holiday season about being able to dress you or your dog (or both) up in costumes, with no judgment from the internet. Take full advantage of doing a Halloween photoshoot with your dog! You will love the photos and the memories, and your dog is sure to love the outside playtime and extra attention! Pack your pup an adorable costume (again no judgment in two or three) and take them on an outdoor adventure to the perfect spot for your fall shoot! Once you find your set, try letting your dog explore and play in their costume while you take great action shots. But what&#8217;s better than a few cute pictures of your dog? Great photos of you and your dog, of course! Get in the spirit and join the photoshoot yourself and take some doggy-owner shots together. Try doing a matching or themed costume for added cute points on social media! Not sure of what to dress up as for your fall shoot? Try one of these classic human &amp; dog costume pairs like Cop &amp; Robber, Dorothy &amp; Todo, Shaggy &amp; Scooby, Charlie Brown &amp; Snoopy, just for some suggestions. Make sure you bring some of your Halloween treats as a reward and toys as encouragement for those criminally cute Halloween-themed shots!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dog2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7092\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog2.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Pup-kins</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t talk about celebrating Halloween without Pumpkins! Whether you&#8217;re putting them on your porch or in a pie, they&#8217;re fun to carve, bake, and even more, fun to pick yourself. There are many pet-friendly pumpkin picking patches. Pick the perfect pumpkins for all your decorating, carving, and baking needs alongside your favorite animal helper. You and your dog will love the time in nature, and your pet will love playing with and eating them. Challenge yourself by trying to carve one that looks just like your puppy for their very own pup-kin, a bonus that they make great Halloween decor for your pet party!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Have a pet costume party!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever wanted to be in a room full of dogs in costumes? Make that adorable fantasy an even cuter reality by getting you and your doggies BFFs (best furry friends) together for a fun Halloween pet party! Get the gang together in their favorite costumes for some scary good times! It&#8217;s a fun reason to get together and a great way for your dogs to get some socialization. If you&#8217;re not sure what to do at your puppy party, just try any of the activities on this list. Things like costumes, doggie bobbing, and pup-kin carving make great contests and photoshoots are an adorable way to have a howl at your party. Your Halloween pet party is the perfect place for your old dogs to show off their new tricks and for you to show off your new baking skills and tasty treats with your pack!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dog3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7093\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/10/dog3.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Get out for a fright night!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to leave your best friend at home to check out scary events and to have a haunted Halloween. And it certainly isn&#8217;t Halloween if you aren&#8217;t getting a good scare in! Many of Winnipeg&#8217;s favorite things to do like corn mazes, the zoo, pumpkin picking patches are pet friendly! Just make sure you check before you go, and make sure you know it&#8217;s not going to be too much for your pup. You want to be scared, not your dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Doggie Bobbing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds similar to the long-standing tradition of bobbing for apples right? You get buckets full of water, throw some apples in, and usually run a contest between a few people to see who can get them all out the fastest. Both harder than it looks and wildly entertaining to watch, it&#8217;s a time-tested favorite for a reason!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try giving this old favorite a cute twist by letting your puppy-pal try their paw at doggie bobbing! If you don&#8217;t want to use apples or you have a smaller dog, you can use tennis balls or pool toys. If it&#8217;s just you and your pooch, fill one bin or a bucket that is a good size for your dog with water, toss in some floating treats, toys, apples, and watch and be howling in laughter! If your dog doesn&#8217;t start bobbing for apples at the sight of the bucket- don&#8217;t panic. You may have to encourage your pup by showing them what to do and that it is there for them!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Trick-Or-Treat / Halloween Dog Walk</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but never least, celebrate Halloween the way it is intended to be celebrated, with actual trick-or-treating! Dress you and your dog up in amazing costumes, walk the neighborhood enjoying the costumes, decorations, and maybe trick-or-treating a little.

I found lots of recipes that serve up bite-sized portions on lettuce leaves, crackers, even potato salad <em>inside another tiny potato </em>(I didn’t even know you could <em>do</em> that!). However, all of this re-portioning is finicky and I’m not about that life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, for my summer BBQs, I’m opting for things <em>already</em> personally portioned. There’s none of this going back to divvy things up, or repurposing upside down muffin tins to try to make parmesan cheese cups or something (which sound incredible!) Props to you if you want to go through that process, but that’s too tedious for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll lay out my top picks, so whatever you’ve volunteered (or been voluntold) to bring, you’ve got options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Salad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t want to bash salad too hard; there are many enjoyable salads &#8211; taco salad for instance. Also, potato salad, pasta salad, I love me a good corn and black bean salad. A bowl of lettuce and loosely chopped veggies though? I’m not into it. I digress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What <em>does</em> work for me?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-10 wp-block-gallery-9 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"732\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/saladroll.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6921\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/saladroll.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6921\" class=\"wp-image-6921\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll.png 732w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-300x221.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-293x216.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-500x369.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Salad Rolls</strong> &#8211; luscious rice paper wrapped delicacies filled with vermicelli, fresh herbs, pickled veggies and BBQ pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are a summer staple in my home. Be warned that if you opt to make them yourself, rice paper wraps are delicate and can be difficult to work with. They’re always tasty but often mine aren’t what you’d call <em>pretty</em>. You may want to try out a few before making a batch to present to the family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is home to some outstanding Vietnamese restaurants. Call ahead and order enough for the whole crew! Pick them up on your way over, and arrive at your party as a hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Sides</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, proteins are the star of the show, but what would they be without the support of some stellar side dishes? I suggest:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Devilled Eggs</strong> &#8211; If there was ever a time for the return of this devillishy delectable appetizer it’s now. Half a hard-boiled egg filled with creamy, seasoned yolk is a tantalizing, two bite snack. I’ll admit I’ve not made these myself. But, as someone who very much wants to eat these, I strongly encourage this choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that isn’t your style, how about&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers</strong> &#8211; These I <em>have</em> made, and they’re legendary (or maybe legen-DAIRY! Spoiler, they’re filled with cheese). To make these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Gut your jalapenos.<ol><li>I recommend wearing disposable gloves for this. Cut them in half and remove the pith (white bit) and seeds to reduce the worst of the heat.</li></ol><ol><li>If you’re really spice intolerant (like me) you can place the de-seeded peppers in boiling water for a few minutes to mellow them out.</li></ol></li><li>Fill them with a combination of your favorite cheeses.<ol><li>I recommend mixing shreds of a strong flavoured cheese like a smoked gouda or fresh parmesan up with some cream cheese, salt, and pepper for a scoopable cheesy filling.</li></ol></li><li>Wrap the filled jalapeno halves with a strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick.<ol><li>You still want it to be pliable enough to wrap, but I recommend partially cooking the bacon first to cut down on finishing time later.</li></ol></li><li>Bake in the oven or set on the grill until the bacon is fully cooked and voilà! You can’t go wrong with bacon and cheese.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have the time or the gumption for all that work, here are some simpler and just as appetizing appetizers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corn on the cob</strong> &#8211; This straightforward and classic BBQ staple is great on its own or can be jazzed up a ton of different ways. Try adding ingredients like lime juice and sweet chili sauce, or ranch and cheddar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-12 wp-block-gallery-11 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"980\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pineapple.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6923\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pineapple.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6923\" class=\"wp-image-6923\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple.png 980w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-500x333.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grilled Pineapple</strong> &#8211; Slice off rounds of this hearty fruit and throw them on the grill. When you take them off, finish with a sprinkle of cinnamon for a side that’s as delicious as it is easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mains</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect to see the regulars at BBQs this summer &#8211; hot dogs, burgers, steak, and chicken. But if you want to avoid the usual burger assembly with shared condiments and a pile of communal lettuce, may I suggest:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Stuffed Peppers </em></strong>&#8211; robust self-contained meals that need no accoutrement. Traditionally they’re filled with a mixture of ground beef, rice, and tomato sauce, then topped with cheese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t let that limit you though &#8211; you can pack these bad boys with whatever you want. I did a combination of pulled pork, mushrooms, and rice last week and they were <em>amazing!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key when grilling these is to make sure that the filling isn’t runny so it doesn’t all pour out when you tip it on its side. I recommend cooking these for a bit in a pan or on the cool side of the grill to soften the peppers, and then finishing them off over the flames for those ever-appealing grill lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Desserts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was so hard not to focus this whole thing on desserts. I recognize that people like to eat other things too, but why bother when you could just have dessert?!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a baker, cakes and pies can be scaled down to <strong>cupcakes or tarts</strong>. I really like the idea of having a whole (albeit tiny) pie all to myself! Everyone loves a cupcake, and I’ve got a foolproof recipe to please any crowd. For a ridiculously simple and customizable cupcake:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Take a box of white cake mix and ignoring the additional ingredients it calls for, combine it with any 355 ml can of soda you like to make the batter.</li><li>Then, dish the batter into your pans and bake according to the box instructions for a soft, fluffy, and soda flavored cake.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a batch of root beer float cupcakes this way and topped them with homemade swiss meringue buttercream frosting (which held up impeccably in the heat!). Don’t worry, a can of your favorite store bought frosting will work just as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For something a little lighter, Pinterest inspired an <strong>ice cream cone fruit salad </strong>which is (as you might expect) an ice cream cone filled with whatever fruits and berries you like. Top them with a little of <strong>Mama Dawn’s Famous Fruit Dip</strong>. It’s a quick recipe:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Take a 250 ml container of sour cream and stir in 2 tablespoons of brown sugar until completely combined.</li><li>Taste and add additional sugar if desired.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Downtown Winnipeg hosts a plethora of fantastic bakeries and confectionery shops where you can pick up a stunning contribution to the party with none of that extra effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is one more very important food category that has not been addressed yet:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"812\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kebab2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6924\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2.png 812w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Anything on a stick!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kebabs</strong> are the ultimate individual BBQ food, and if you can put it on a stick, it can be kebab’d. They’re perfect for an appetizer, main dish or even dessert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine sausage, steak, shrimp, or chicken with your favourite veggies &#8211; tomatoes, pineapple, onion, peppers, etc. &#8211; and you have yourself a killer kebab!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite combination has to be the Manitoba kebab, complete with Farmer sausage and mini perogies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For something more refreshing, try a kebab with watermelon and some cubed feta cheese. Or, you can load up some marshmallows and chocolate for a s’more stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get creative! When it comes to kebabs, the skewer’s the limit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps to inspire some great barbeque grub! With individual options for everyone, you can focus less on shared cutlery and more on shared conversations. Happy barbequing!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Barbecuing is already the quintessential summer activity.

It is not because such things as eating passion fruit gelato can be done in July particularly (after all, who would in a right mind choose that flavour during Christmas time?), but because choosing fruit flavours ice cream as well as eating on the patio makes sense in Winnipeg only during the hot season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons why Manitobans await summertime with such thirst and desire; one of them is anticipation of sitting on a patio with friends and family while sipping on craft cocktails. To add to the usual excitement of moments when patios start opening in the late spring, this season we also receive them with open arms because restaurants have been closed for an extended period. Today, we prepared a list of five famous downtown restaurants with available patio seating and the finest cuisines.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6916\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Forth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Forth bar, as customers say, is an absolutely beautiful bar with a marvellous patio. Truly, the place combines a coffee shop with a vivid hipster vibe on the main floor and a rooftop patio bar that overlooks Exchange District. In fact, the best time to visit the rooftop is right before the sunset hour. When golden sunlight touches downtown buildings, old and new alike, one no longer has a feeling that tomorrow is another workday; on the contrary, at the Forth rooftop bar, one feels like on a vacation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the food and drinks options, you can order such quick snacks as avocado toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, croissants, yogurt parfait and others, while the bar on the roof offers craft cocktails. As satisfied customers mentioned, you can tell the bartender about the flavours you like, and they will invent a cocktail just for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.forth.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.forth.ca/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cibo Waterfront Café</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cibo Waterfront offers a variety of Mediterranean-inspired foods like bruschetta, pizza, pasta and a selection of wines and beer. Customers confess that this restaurant is an enjoyable place for late-night food and drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while you might find quality pasta at many other places, the main attraction, in this case, is the location and the building itself. Like many other fashionable dining spots, Cibo locates in a former industrial building. (Pump and Screen House used to provide water coolant to Winnipeg’s Steam Heating Plant). The building still presents a high ceiling, massive windows, and brick walls: altogether, with a simple yet elegant interior, it creates a unique atmosphere. The patio has comfortably assembled tables and couches. At the moment, they, however, do not accept any reservation; instead, it is first-come, first-serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, across the road is the Mere Hotel. Thus, if you are a visitor in the city it might be a fine option for accommodation with a walking distance restaurant choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Browns Socialhouse Portage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers say Browns Socialhouse serves the best Caesar salad they have had in Winnipeg so far. Nevertheless, if you are not looking for the best salad in the city, but simply want a cozy patio with heaters, comfortable chairs, music, and city lights all around, this restaurant is worth checking out. Even though Browns Socialhouse belongs to a chain brand, according to many customers’ reviews it is one of the favourite places among locals. Some appreciate service; some enjoy a location that is right in the middle of downtown, and all of them, of course, agree that food is both tasty and comforting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu is enormous compared to other restaurants and offers a variety of cuisines. You can find sushi, soups, salads, fish and chips, burgers, pasta, famous bowls and tacos.
