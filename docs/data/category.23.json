May the best leprechaun win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A St. Patrick’s Day spin on Bobbing For Apples</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know and love the Halloween age-old tradition of bobbing for apples, right? Well, if you want to challenge your guests this year, try having them bob for The Lucky Charms. Get bowls of lucky charms, have one person blindfolded on each side, and try and pick out the marshmallow pieces of the lucky charms the fastest.

Check out our two favorite St. Patricks Day contests to include at your 2022 bash.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Costume Contest</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold a contest for the best St. Patricks Day costume. The prize goes to the most creative, most spirit or just the one you didn’t see coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>Cocktail Contest</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the contest idea? Get participants to make their best the cuff Irish and St. Patrick Day-themed cocktails, and may the best one win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go on a street crawl</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If none of the above fit your Irish appetite or you rather keep to yourself, try celebrating by going on your street crawl. Make sure you throw on some green to avoid getting pinched and embark on your own St Patrick&#8217;s day adventure. Try taking a walk through the city where St Patrick&#8217;s day is in full swing, and enjoy watching the city turn green!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>St. Patricks Day the Self Care Way; Keep Calm and Celebrate St Patrick!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rather stay in and keep calm this St Patricks day but still want to stay in the holiday spirit, try indulging in some St Patrick day themed self-care. Start by brewing yourself an Irish coffee, run a bath with a goat’s milk soak and green-themed oils like peppermint, and let the stress melt away to the sounds of relaxing Irish music.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hangover the Irish Way</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While St Patrick’s Day is a nationally beloved holiday, it is not exactly a nationally absorbed holiday in the way of anyone having the day off. Unlike New Year’s Eve, where we all have a national hangover day on January 1st (and most places on the 2nd too), not too many places close on St. Patricks Day. If you find yourself hungover and have to go to work this St. Patricks Day, try one of these Irish remedies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"941\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sp3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7534\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3.jpg 941w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/sp3-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Full Irish Breakfast<br>-Bacon<br>-Eggs<br>-Sausages<br>-Black Pudding<br>-Beans<br>-Fried Tomatoes</li><li>Irish Coffee<br>The best cure to a hangover for many the next day is the good old classic coffee.

The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks is already a beloved Winnipeg Spot, a hot spot for activities, shows, tours, and history. With many new exciting additions, even if you&#8217;re already local to The Forks, you&#8217;ll want to plan a trip there for sure. With new one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants, and even a new arcade, this old favourite feels like a new one!

The Trolly has been a tourist staple of downtown Winnipeg for many years already. With in-depth city tours and bookable ghost tours, they are definitely worth the ride! Prefer an indoor tour? Many of Downtown&#8217;s museums offer free or affordable admission. The WAG does free exhibits and days (selected dates), as well as a discounted rate on the first Wednesday of the month for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. But there are many other museums Downtown you can check out that offer cheap or free admission, such as the Winnipeg Police Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Events</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is full of exciting activities all season long! Enjoy things like yoga and fitness in the park, movies, concerts, and more!

Take a Downtown Patio Crawl</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy a stroll downtown and some of Winnipeg&#8217;s best food and patios on a Downtown patio crawl. One of the best things about being in Downtown Winnipeg is everything is relatively close to each other, including Winnipeg&#8217;s best patio spots!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t be doing a downtown patio crawl without stopping in at Winnipeg&#8217;s already favorite spot, The Forks! With two new bars, one indoor and one outdoor, an extended licensed patio seating area, and not to mention tons of delicious restaurants to pick up some fantastic food at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Roca</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closely connecting the next few stops on Smith Street is La Roca. They are known for their impressive selection of tequila, delicious Mexican cuisine, and good patio right in the heart of downtown Winnipeg!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tavern United Roof-Top</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Downtown Tavern United (<em>aka roof-top-tav</em>) has a nice rooftop patio and bar that gives you an exciting view of Downtown!

It is not because such things as eating passion fruit gelato can be done in July particularly (after all, who would in a right mind choose that flavour during Christmas time?), but because choosing fruit flavours ice cream as well as eating on the patio makes sense in Winnipeg only during the hot season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons why Manitobans await summertime with such thirst and desire; one of them is anticipation of sitting on a patio with friends and family while sipping on craft cocktails. To add to the usual excitement of moments when patios start opening in the late spring, this season we also receive them with open arms because restaurants have been closed for an extended period. Today, we prepared a list of five famous downtown restaurants with available patio seating and the finest cuisines.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6916\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Forth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Forth bar, as customers say, is an absolutely beautiful bar with a marvellous patio. Truly, the place combines a coffee shop with a vivid hipster vibe on the main floor and a rooftop patio bar that overlooks Exchange District. In fact, the best time to visit the rooftop is right before the sunset hour. When golden sunlight touches downtown buildings, old and new alike, one no longer has a feeling that tomorrow is another workday; on the contrary, at the Forth rooftop bar, one feels like on a vacation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the food and drinks options, you can order such quick snacks as avocado toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, croissants, yogurt parfait and others, while the bar on the roof offers craft cocktails. As satisfied customers mentioned, you can tell the bartender about the flavours you like, and they will invent a cocktail just for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.forth.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.forth.ca/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cibo Waterfront Café</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cibo Waterfront offers a variety of Mediterranean-inspired foods like bruschetta, pizza, pasta and a selection of wines and beer. Customers confess that this restaurant is an enjoyable place for late-night food and drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while you might find quality pasta at many other places, the main attraction, in this case, is the location and the building itself. Like many other fashionable dining spots, Cibo locates in a former industrial building. (Pump and Screen House used to provide water coolant to Winnipeg’s Steam Heating Plant). The building still presents a high ceiling, massive windows, and brick walls: altogether, with a simple yet elegant interior, it creates a unique atmosphere. The patio has comfortably assembled tables and couches. At the moment, they, however, do not accept any reservation; instead, it is first-come, first-serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, across the road is the Mere Hotel. Thus, if you are a visitor in the city it might be a fine option for accommodation with a walking distance restaurant choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Browns Socialhouse Portage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers say Browns Socialhouse serves the best Caesar salad they have had in Winnipeg so far. Nevertheless, if you are not looking for the best salad in the city, but simply want a cozy patio with heaters, comfortable chairs, music, and city lights all around, this restaurant is worth checking out. Even though Browns Socialhouse belongs to a chain brand, according to many customers’ reviews it is one of the favourite places among locals. Some appreciate service; some enjoy a location that is right in the middle of downtown, and all of them, of course, agree that food is both tasty and comforting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu is enormous compared to other restaurants and offers a variety of cuisines. You can find sushi, soups, salads, fish and chips, burgers, pasta, famous bowls and tacos. And, to accompany all that food there is a broad menu of wines, beer, and cocktails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://brownssocialhouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">https://brownssocialhouse.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"835\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6917\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2.png 835w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>SMITH</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SMITH restaurant is located at the Forks, the area so loved by both locals and tourists. It is an upscale, modern, yet casual space with so much thought put into interior design and menu. The whole atmosphere of the restaurant, which is conveniently located inside the Inn at the Forks hotel, is finished in a unique combination of slick lines of wooden furniture, comfortable seating and virtuously prepared and served food. As for the patio, this year SMITH restaurant offers a new pop-up space in front of the hotel facing the Oodena Circle and Johnston Terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu is based on simple, yet freshest ingredients, and celebration of lands and water of the country: the focus is on cooking from locally produced and seasonal products of Canada. You can find such dishes as steaks, salads, grilled vegetables, burgers and more. Additionally, to accompany the fresh taste of ingredients, order some wine from Okanagan valley or craft cocktails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca/\">https://smithrestaurant.ca/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Peasant Cookery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Peasant Cookery is another local restaurant that deserves attention and a visit at least once a season for no other reason but to celebrate summertime. As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere of the 20th century overwhelms you, and the feeling that you are in the middle of a historic drama is inevitable. The restaurant is located right in the heart of Exchange District, and monumental buildings around and pleasant atmosphere in the restaurant create a unique dining experience. According to many satisfied customers, Peasant Cookery is the choice number one for anniversary celebration: dishes are simple and delicious, and the atmosphere is sophisticated yet down to earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu offers dishes cooked from fresh, locally sourced ingredients along with wines, local beers and craft cocktails. There are such pleasures as escargots, mussels, charcuterie boards, salmon, tarte flambé and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell us about your favourite patio in downtown Winnipeg and enjoy your summer cocktail!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://peasantcookery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">https://peasantcookery.ca/</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are certain activities we associate with summertime only.

Goodbye winter jackets and hello spring dresses. Who doesn’t love the smell of freshly cut grass in the air? The sight of colorful flowers finally popping up in the soil?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is one of the most awaited seasons for most of us in Winnipeg. Winters are too cold and summers can sometimes be too hot. With limited mobility though, some of us might not feel as excited to greet the season as others normally do. But have no fear! There is still a lot to do in the city! And downtown has some attractive places to offer!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, look at that sun shining. And a quick check at the weather app confirms it is 20 degrees. A warm day means it’s the perfect time to try out some new ice cream flavors. <a href=\"https://www.feteicecreamcoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fête on Assiniboine Avenue</a> is a cute little ice cream shop that boasts of not only great ice cream, but amazing coffee, cakes and waffle crisps (I didn’t know this was a thing, but it is! And this taste delicious with ice cream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus? You can take a stroll in the park next door as you enjoy your favorite flavor of ice cream. Bonnycastle Park also has a little dog park in the vicinity, so it’s a great spot to go to for you and your furry pal to enjoy a sweet treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png\" alt=\"Dog Running in the field\" class=\"wp-image-6739\" width=\"761\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png 655w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-293x165.png 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another favorite ice cream spot is <a href=\"https://chaebanicecream.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chaeban on Osbsorne</a>. They have some amazing flavors with very wholesome ingredients. I kid you not, I could taste real mint leaves in their mint ice cream. Their outdoor sitting area offers the perfect opportunity to enjoy a relaxed evening outdoors just enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown while having a heavenly treat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sough after landmark to enjoy the season is the Forks Market. You can pop inside the market to check out stores that offer unique handmade items or simply roam around the Commons to grab a drink and enjoy the sun. The area also offers a scenic view and a track along the river where you can bike or jog to soak up some sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if you enjoy history there are some great monuments to see. And if you’re more into modern art, they’ve recently set up the ‘Forever Bicycles’ monument along with other art pieces to view. If you have little kids to entertain alongside, they have great play structures and a splash pad to cool off after all the walking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking alongside the Riverwalk at <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Forks </a>can take you to another landmark in downtown, the Legislative Building. With its extensive gardens and fountain, you can not only get a scenic view to enjoy a cup of coffee, but also admire the structure of the Legislative Building itself with the golden boy shining in all his glory. It makes for a lovely backdrop for some great pictures, especially during sunset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg also offers an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visit the Exchange District</a>, very close to the intersection of Portage and Main, one of the most popular intersections in all of Canada. The Exchange District has heritage buildings so if you’re looking for a sneak peek into the city’s past, it’s the perfect twenty blocks for a stroll. You can expect to see restaurants, theatres and the Old Market Square with its quaint backdrop. &nbsp;Each structure has a story to tell, if we only have the time to listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not a history or art buff like me, and prefer instead to be surrounded by nature, maybe listening to some water flowing or birds chirping then I have a great spot for you. But where will you find a spot like that in downtown amidst all the hustle and bustle of Main Street? Not too far I promise. In fact, it’s in our very own downtown.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-14 wp-block-gallery-13 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6741\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6741\" class=\"wp-image-6741\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the idea of sitting on a picnic blanket and sipping some lemonade sounds appealing to you then look no further, and I mean literally! I recently discovered this cute little park called Happyland Park right here in downtown. It has an amazing view of the river, rolling green hills and a great play area for the kids. There are sitting areas made if you aren’t the picnic blanket sort and the open green space is a real treat for the eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also check out <a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/information/discovering-ufg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park on Main Street</a>. It not only has light and sound shows but sometimes, you might be able to spot yoga enthusiasts practicing. Feel free to join in if you’re looking for an opportunity to unwind!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring in Winnipeg is like a finicky hotel guest, looking for a reason to check out. So let’s try to make the most out of this season. Use it to explore downtown, take long walks, eat lots of ice cream and smell that fresh grass every chance you get!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liked the article? <a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/its-ice-cream-time-a-guide-to-downtown-winnipeg-ice-cream-shops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here and check our definitive guide to Ice Cream shops in Downtown!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finally!

The warm embrace of an amber afternoon, the bluntness of the nippy air, the inviting smell of apples and spice… September marks the halt of weekends at the lake, picnics in the park and sipping icy drinks on a sweltering afternoon.</p>\n<p>Winnipeggers don’t immediately think of downtown when they wonder where to spend an autumn day, but it’s my go-to spot!</p>\n<h3>Stroll the Assiniboine River</h3>\n<p>Fall is perfect for taking beautiful scenic photos and spending time outdoors. There’s nothing more relaxing and rejuvenating than enjoying nature. One of my favourite places in downtown during fall is along the Assiniboine River—I love the crisp air and the carpet of leaves crunching beneath my feet as I stroll the path. It’s always confounded me that the sound of dead leaves can make the air crackle with life.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></p>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Denise Runions (@msdeerun)</a> on Oct 22, 2016 at 11:02am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My route usually starts at the Forks, where I grab a steaming cup of joe from <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>. Warming beverage in hand, I make my way west, ending up outside the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a>. Even when other people are using the path, the river walkway is a serene place to spend autumn days.</p>\n<h3>Hot Drinks to Warm You Up (&amp; Where to Find Them)</h3>\n<p>The fragrant aromas of apple cider and hot cocoa are the ultimate reminder that fall is in the air! Downtown Winnipeg is the hub for the top-of-the-line coffee shops, and the place to be to satisfy your pumpkin-spiced cravings. Coffee shops such as <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/home-blend\">Thom Bargen</a> or <a href=\"https://secondcup.com/location/254-edmonton-street\">Second Cup Coffee Co.</a> are some of my top-picks for their seasonal drink menus. Here are some of my favourite seasonal drinks, guaranteed to have you feeling warm and toasty from the inside out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\"><strong>Fools and Horses</strong></a><br />\nFools and Horses is not afraid to get a little creative with hot fall drinks; they offer pumpkin spice lattes, but their Boreal Latte truly shines! This delicious beverage is created with one-of-a-kind ingredients including pine syrup, sage, sweetgrass, elderflower, and juniper. Trust me: it’s something special.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></p>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by grace demers (@gracedmrs)</a> on Sep 22, 2019 at 6:52pm PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/home-blend\"><strong>Thom Bargen</strong></a><br />\nThe pumpkin spiced latte is the spokesperson for fall drinks, and in my opinion, no one does pumpkin drinks better than Thom Bargen!

I’m not sure if there’s any actual science behind that, but in my mind, it’s a fact.</p>\n<p>The days can still be hot and sunny, but the sun rises later, the mornings are cooler and a 10 pm sunset is a distant memory. It’s too early to think about winter, and definitely too early to give up on enjoying a Winnipeg summer.</p>\n<p>And to me, that means continuing to spend as much time as possible outdoors, enjoying picnics! Yes, you heard me right: good, old-fashioned picnics. Winnipeg makes it easy as, with abundant public parks and green spaces where you can spread your picnic blanket. Most Winnipeg parks are open from 7 am to 10 pm.</p>\n<p>Here is my list of four parks in Winnipeg that should be at the top of your picnic list!</p>\n<h3>Bruce Park</h3>\n<p><em>1966 Portage Ave.</em></p>\n<p>Truth be told, I never knew that Bruce Park existed until a friend told me! The embarrassing part is that I have driven by this park countless times. It just goes to show how often we don’t really notice what is right there in front of us.</p>\n<p>Sitting on 4.4 hectares of land south of Portage Avenue, and just east of the Assiniboine Park foot bridge, Bruce Park offers a number of options for picnickers. It has a few tables, a few well-placed benches, and plenty of space to roll out a blanket.</p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Quiet refuge away from the hustle and bustle of downtown life.</p>\n<p>• Parking access is available from the lane that borders the park to the west.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities only available when the pool is open.</p>\n<h3>Crescent Drive Park</h3>\n<p><em>781 Crescent Drive</em></p>\n<p>There are so many reasons to love this park. From the wildlife that shares its space, to the Red River that passes it by. Wildlife, you ask? In addition to birds and squirrels, a number of deer call Crescent Drive Park home. There’s also a monarch butterfly garden nearby. Visit at the right time of year, and you may find yourself being entertained by these little beauties.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5840\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5840\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crescent Drive Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Natural setting along the Red River, close to <a href=\"https://www.thermea.ca/\">Thermëa</a> and the <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/golf/crescent.stm\">Crescent Drive Golf Course</a>.</p>\n<p>• Plenty of parking.</p>\n<p>• BBQ pits available.</p>\n<p>• Portable toilets provided while a new picnic shelter and washroom facilities being rebuilt.</p>\n<h3>La Barrière Park</h3>\n<p><em>4403 Waverley St.</em></p>\n<p>While not technically in Winnipeg, La Barrière Park is just too good to leave off this list!</p>\n<p>I first fell in love with La Barrière Park in winter because it’s a great place to walk my dogs. It now calls to me year-round, with or without the dogs. Its trails lead you over the La Salle River and through a mature forest where you can run, jog, or walk. The slow-moving La Salle River is quite popular with paddlers. My camera also professes a love for this park, and always finds something to capture.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5841\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5841\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5841 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">La Barriere Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Proximity to the city and variety of picnic settings to choose from.</p>\n<p>• Interesting nature trails.</p>\n<p>• BBQ pits available.</p>\n<p>• Sites available to book for larger groups.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities on site.</p>\n<h3>Assiniboine Forest</h3>\n<p><em>Situated between Chalfont Avenue to the west and Shaftsbury Boulevard to the east.</em></p>\n<p>Finally, la pièce de résistance! If you want to feel like you are in a natural park and without leaving the city, Assiniboine Forest is the place for you. This park will appeal to both the explorer and the observer in you. Its trails range in length from 1.1 km to 2.8 km, and lead you through everything from thick forest to wetlands. Make your way to the Eve Werier Memorial Pond to enjoy a beautiful observation area with plenty of seating.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5842\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5842\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5842\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assiniboine Forest, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Trees, trails, wetlands, and prairie grasses make this park a microcosm of Manitoba.</p>\n<p>• Parking lot is located at the corner of Grant Avenue and Chalfont Road.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities available at the entrance.</p>\n<p>• Five trails to explore.</p>\n<h3>Packing Your Picnic Basket</h3>\n<p>The beauty of a picnic is that you can make it as simple or as elaborate as you want!

Maybe you’re drawn in by the menu, the decor, the service, or a beautiful combination of all three. Or maybe it has that certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca/\">Smith Restaurant</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a> is one of those places.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re enjoying a staycation, a family gathering, or looking for a more intimate <em>rendezvous</em> (yes, even for breakfast), Smith Restaurant should be at the top of your list.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>Country chic. Comfortable. Warm and modern. In a nutshell, Smith’s interior is a blend of styles with something to appeal to everyone. And, given that Smith is a popular spot not only for breakfast but dinner and the after-dinner crowd as well, its appeal transcends the morning hours. Let’s call it <em>Canadiana</em> fusion, with wood features, modern lighting, leather and benches covered in <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> point blankets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5361\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5361\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast, Smith Restaurant, Inn at The Forks, The Forks, Meet Me At The Forks, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Living Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg Restaurants, Where To Eat Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/IMG_3730-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside the Smith Restaurant</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>The service</h3>\n<p>Professional and yet personable fits the service to a tee. From the host, who was unfazed when we showed up early for our reservation, to our server Angela, with whom we shared a few good laughs. The service matched the situation and exceeded our expectations.</p>\n<h3>The menu</h3>\n<p>“Not your mama’s eggs” comes to mind when describing the menu. Not that there is anything wrong with her eggs, but Smith’s chefs have succeeded in creating a menu that features local, seasonal, and Canadian products, which really bumps those eggs up to the next level. Sure, you can order the Hotel Breakfast—which consists of some good old-fashioned eggs with a choice of bacon or sausage—or oatmeal (with a Saskatoon berry twist), but there are a few more interesting options.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtbGNNzgKD6/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It might be the Scandinavian blood in me, but the Eggs Copenhagen called, and I was not disappointed. Two poached eggs with smoked lox and rösti potato came together nicely. Of course, no breakfast would be complete without a good cup of tea or coffee, and here, too, we pleasantly surprised.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual selection of teas, cappuccino, espresso, and Americano coffees, Smith offers a French press coffee option. We gave the French press a try, and it was exquisite.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to kick off your day with some good food, give Smith a try. Perhaps you, too, will find that it has that <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<p>Feedback on <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154954-d7078344-Reviews-Smith_Restaurant-Winnipeg_Manitoba.html\">TripAdvisor rates Smith a four out of five</a> with “value” having the lowest rating.

The menu has tons of options to try on your subsequent visits, so variety isn’t an issue. Everything is decently priced, with nothing on the menu costing more than $40. Peasant Cookery is a perfect date night spot or a place to get the girls together to enjoy a specialty cocktail.

No matter what you choose, you’ll leave satisfied and on the verge of a pleasant food coma.

Housed in a cozy cafe a few blocks deep into <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\">Exchange District</a>, Across the Board is the antithesis to digital culture. It’s the perfect space for spending quality time with close friends. They also offer an abundance of <a href=\"https://acrosstheboardcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ATB_WeeklyLunchMenu_Feb01_2018.pdf\">comfort food</a>, so you can share a bowl of popcorn with the people on your team, or dive into a warm, gooey bowl of mac &amp; cheese.</p>\n<p><em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong>Dill pickle popcorn or a taco pizza</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.tipsycowwpg.com/\">Tipsy Cow</a>: $</h3>\n<p>285 Portage Avenue</p>\n<p>Tipsy Cow is a unique pub-style restaurant that offers <a href=\"https://www.tipsycowwpg.com/menu\">gourmet burgers</a>, craft beer, poutine, and thick milkshakes.

It’s also a cozy date-night or gathering spot for you and close friends, thanks to the rich interior and excellent music.</p>\n<p>The service is fast, friendly, and accommodating; Friday nights are usually busy, but the servers will make sure to make you still feel like a guest rather than just another table.</p>\n<p><em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong>The Winnipegger burger, onion rings, and a salted caramel milkshake</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.deerandalmond.com/\">Deer + Almond</a>: $$</h3>\n<p>85 Princess Street</p>\n<p>The plates are designed for sharing with your friends or a date.

This is not your average movie date: pre-movie, you’ll be wined and dined with the Mets’ signature buffet; during the movie, you’ll enjoy hot-off-the-press buttery popcorn. Does your average <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=netflix%20and%20chill\">Netflix and chill</a> session come with an intermission to delight your senses with coffee and dessert?<em> I don’t think so</em>. Create your own “We’ll always have Paris” moment and get carried away on all the romance in the air.</p>\n<h3>4.

Located in Peg Beer Co.’s previous location behind the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, Nonsuch had a soft opening during <a href=\"http://nuitblanchewinnipeg.ca/\">Nuit Blanche</a>, exhibiting dozens of golden umbrellas on its ceiling, illuminated by just as many light bulbs. The room is tastefully decorated with black walls, so-comfy-you-sink-in-them sofas, and modern furniture. The vibe is very relaxed, perfect for both groups and couples.</p>\n<p>Everything on their menu is $7: every beer, ranging from a Belgian blonde to a Baltic porter, is $7 (those with a higher ABV are served in slightly smaller quantity). Nosh on a delicious fruit and nut plate or dig into a massive bowl of popcorn with your choice of dill, chilli pepper, or truffle seasoning. The fantastic beer, relaxed atmosphere, and stellar service are sure to make Nonsuch Brewing Co. your new go-to bar—it’s definitely mine!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forth.ca\">Forth Cocktail Bar</a></h3>\n<p>171 McDermot Ave<br />\nTuesday to Thursday, 4 pm to 1 am<br />\nFriday to Saturday, 4 pm to 2 am<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.forth.ca\">forth.ca</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2033\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2033\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfd_oG9nvQf/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2033\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/by-travis_ross-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Bartender, Forth, People, Talking\" width=\"940\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-travis_ross-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-travis_ross-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-travis_ross-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-travis_ross-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-travis_ross.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2033\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @travis_ross on @forth_wpg Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If you live or work downtown, chances are you’ve been to Forth for a coffee and a quick bite, or even to their tiny rooftop bar in the summer.

The bar offers light bites, wine and beer, premium spirits (like mezcal and <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/c/35/japanese-whisky\">Japanese whisky</a>), and great cocktails. The bartenders are also highly knowledgeable, so they encourage guests to let go of the reins and try something new by ordering the “Bartender’s Choice.” The space of this speakeasy is dark and cosy, making it a great spot for a late night cocktail.</p>\n<p>Make sure to head to Forth Cocktail Bar on a Friday night for their weekly <a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/events/2018/7/27/forth-fridays\">Forth Fridays</a> event, where one of their resident DJs will be spinning their playlist from 10 pm until late.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://amsterdamtearoom.com\">Amsterdam Tea Room</a></h3>\n<p>103-211 Bannatyne Ave<br />\nTuesday to Saturday, 10 am to 12 am<br />\n<a href=\"http://amsterdamtearoom.com\">amsterdamtearoom.com</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2050\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2050\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BiFovi-nyKy/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2050\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/by-amsterdamtearoomandbar-1024x648.jpg\" alt=\"Watching the Jets, Winnipeg Jets, People Drinking\" width=\"940\" height=\"595\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-amsterdamtearoomandbar-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-amsterdamtearoomandbar-500x316.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-amsterdamtearoomandbar-300x190.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-amsterdamtearoomandbar-768x486.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-amsterdamtearoomandbar.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2050\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @amsterdamtearoomandbar on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The absolute best spot for a boozy hot drink during the cold months.

If an establishment has Delirium at all, it’s almost always <a href=\"https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/delirium-tremens/1039/\">Delirium Tremens</a>. Which is why I was so happy to see that in addition to tapas and wine, Cordova also specializes in Belgian beers—complete with the Delirium sign hanging above the bar! My ecstasy at finding Delirium Nocturnum in Winnipeg aside, Cordova is also a fabulous spot for a nightcap.</p>\n<p>They have an extensive wine selection, carefully crafted cocktails, and delicious tapas. The candlelit atmosphere makes Cordova the perfect spot for an intimate nightcap over a bottle of wine and shared small plates, and it’s a must-stop for any Belgian beer aficionado.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">Smith</a></h3>\n<p>75 Forks Market Rd<br />\nMonday to Thursday, 6:30 am to 11 pm<br />\nFriday to Saturday, 6:30 am to 12 am<br />\nSunday, 7 am to 11 pm<br />\n<a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">smithrestaurant.ca</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2056\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2056\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BREdkWXhwJV/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2056\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Winnipeg, Smith Restaurant, Hang out place, Cozy, Lounge\" width=\"940\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-500x325.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-300x195.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-768x498.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @smithwinnipeg on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I realized a few years ago that hotel bars are extremely underrated. They’re usually quiet, relaxed, open late, and offer a great selection of food and drinks and amazing service. Hotel bars just aren’t the first place most people think about when they want to get a drink somewhere! But you don’t need to be a hotel guest to enjoy the hotel bar.</p>\n<p>My favourite hotel bar in the city, and one I’ve been going to for years, is Smith at the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a>. The food is phenomenal, and if you’re not up for a meal, they have a large selection of small plates and sides. (My friends and I usually order a bunch of sides to share.) They have great local beers on tap that rotate regularly, a fantastic wine selection, and some seriously good cocktails. Like, seriously good (try the mezcal and beet cocktail). They have a list of classic cocktails and a list of Smith originals. They even have their own gin! Not to mention the décor is sleek and cosy, and no one is going to bug you if you stay in your <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> blanket booth for hours.</p>\n<h4>So on a cold Winnipeg night, after the Jets have once again made their city proud and you’re craving a nightcap to finish off your evening, try something new! Think of a crisp, locally-brewed beer, a cosy speakeasy, a warm tea cocktail, a juicy glass of wine, and delicious late-night food made by some of Winnipeg’s best kitchens. <a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/\">Downtown Winnipeg</a> has a lot to offer if you know where to look…</h4>\n<p>Have you had a tantalizing nightcap at any of Elena’s favourite spots?
