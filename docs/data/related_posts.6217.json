Plus, there are some breathtaking views! I suggest a good wander around The Exchange for the architecture</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">or </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">timing it so you’re </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">on one of the many bridges overlooking the river at sunset.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OJFkdTRQbr\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/downtown-living-with-susan-ainley/\">Downtown Living with Susan Ainley</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Downtown Living with Susan Ainley&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/downtown-living-with-susan-ainley/embed/#?secret=OJFkdTRQbr\" data-secret=\"OJFkdTRQbr\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.
