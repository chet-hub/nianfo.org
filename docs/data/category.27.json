So we made a quick pitstop to check out 300 Main on our way into the Exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located with bike lanes immediately behind the building and a bi-directional bike lane a block away, it’s easy peasy to get anywhere by bike from 300 Main.&nbsp; It was simple to stop for a quick visit to show my pals, and from there, we used the handy bike lane on Fort Street to connect us to the Exchange and on to our adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10480\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to our first Nuit Blanche stop, we took the Fort Street bike lane, which becomes a protected bike lane once you cross Portage Avenue.&nbsp; We took this to Adelaide Street, where we popped over to Arts Junktion.&nbsp; They were running a bike decorating spot, where you could also get your bike looked over by The Wrench.&nbsp; Now that our bikes and helmets were all decorated, we were ready for the rest of the night!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10481\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes to the Little Brown Jug Brewery Street party and were greeted with great tunes from DJs set up on their newly upgraded patio, food trucks along the closed street, and plenty of amazing beer.&nbsp; We went inside the brewery to check out their art installation, Moths to a Flame, by Warner Carther.&nbsp; Incorporating transparent glass and light projections, the entire space was lit up with flickering flames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to end the night back in the Exchange, which really is the main centre of Nuit Blanche, so from Little Brown Jug, we cycled up Adelaide Street to the McDermot Avenue bi-directional bike lane, then across Main Street to Stephen Juba Park, along Waterfront Drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10482\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-300x235.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-770x603.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-293x229.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two really great installations along the bike and walking path through Stephen Juba Park.&nbsp; The first we saw was Kasuri, located near the Mere Hotel and created by Takashhi Iwasaki &amp; Joe Kalturnyk.&nbsp; This was a fun, interactive light exhibit, where viewers could turn wheels at the side, which made central pieces move and float, like shimmering blue and pink helix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10483\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next stop was Elucida, created by Biom Lab.&nbsp; Elucida resembled beautiful, colourful patio lanterns strung between the large trees in the park.&nbsp; This effect was emphasized by a group that had set up patio chairs and were hanging out, occasionally chatting with passers by that they knew from the mass of people walking through.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10484\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes out from the thick of people and managed to get a nice little ride along the fenced bike path that leads under the Esplanade Riel Bridge.&nbsp; We stopped at the foot of the bridge, behind the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, to take in Ikuma by Geronimo Inutiq, presented by the Winnipeg Art Gallery.&nbsp; Ikuma from Inuktitut translates to flame, fire, or spark, and this audiovisual program was fascinating to watch and listen to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10485\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many different installations and events taking place at The Forks for Nuit Blanche, and we checked out three of them.&nbsp; Homesick Angels by Joshua Banman, located at the CN Stage, was an interactive exhibit where the audience was projected onto a bank of vintage television sets, becoming angels with coloured halos, laser eyes, and flames in their hands.&nbsp; It was mesmerizing to watch and play with, as well as a little eerie and creepy due to the classical music playing softly at the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10486\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also saw Renaissance of Memory by Nayden, set up on the 5th floor of the parkade.&nbsp; With digital projections as well as little vignettes of tables, toys, and televisions dotted throughout the space, this was a fun piece to wander around and explore while contemplating memory, nostalgia, and sentimental longing for childhood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10487\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our final stop at the Forks was to see Bikes, Lights, Nights by Sputnik Architecture with bikes from the Plain Bicycle Project.&nbsp; The project created an upside-down world of suspended, multicolour, lit-up bicycles high in the tree canopy of the Forks Patio (to the left of the harbour, as you face the river).&nbsp; It was truly magical to see!&nbsp; This installation will run until the end of Culture Days, on October 16, so there is still some time to catch it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From The Forks, we zipped along the bike path that leads to Assiniboine Avenue, taking the bi-directional protected bike lane on Garry Street back to the Exchange District.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10488\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To say the Exchange was packed would truly be an understatement!&nbsp; We explored two exhibits along McDermot. Panotptibot II, by Toxic, captured live images from audience participants, projecting them into the walls of a party in the building behind. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10489\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up the street from Panoptibot II,&nbsp; we visited Pop of Art at Tara Davis Studio Boutique, which featured whimsical window installations by Kami Goertz and Darci Madlung that glowed delightfully in black light.

The very first time I had been to Winnipeg was on a cold December afternoon when my family moved from Russia to Canada. Our friends met us at the airport, and we drove straight from the airport to a small city just south of Winnipeg. Winnipeg and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to know each other yet.</p>\n<p>The next few times when I visited Winnipeg with friends, we mainly went shopping at <a href=\"https://www.cfshops.com/polo-park.html\">Polo Park</a>. To really get to know the city, you need to get out and explore its oldest parts. You must open your eyes to seeing history, and your ears to hearing what the city wants to tell you. That is exactly what happened to me when I came back to Winnipeg with a pile of documents to apply to college.</p>\n<p>That morning, my sister and I had one specific mission: to explore. We got Starbucks and started our walk from the <a href=\"https://www.fairmont.com/winnipeg/\">Fairmont Hotel</a> on Portage Avenue, through the <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\">Exchange District</a>, and back to Portage Avenue. I was lifting my eyes, trying to catch architectural details on buildings like the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank on Main Street</a>, <a href=\"http://pantagesplayhouse.com/\">Pantages Playhouse Theatre</a> on Market Street, the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> on King Street, and others. I was enjoying the fresh summer morning air and a strong feeling of familiarity that was pressing on me from all sides. It was a long walk, but that morning something hit me. It was <em>déjà vu</em> feeling that I had already been in this place before. I felt like I&#8217;d seen it before, and not just once.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3876\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3876\" style=\"width: 819px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSe9ybtBCjl/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3876 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-770x963.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-293x366.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @arianneyuson from Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Later, while studying in college and spending all my free time in the Exchange District, I found out that movies about early 20th century Chicago had been shot in Winnipeg. Puzzle pieces fell into place. That is where I had seen these streets before I fell in love with them! I&#8217;d seen the <a href=\"https://mbfilmmusic.ca/en/film/filming-in-manitoba\">streets of Winnipeg in movies</a> when I still lived in Russia.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has been called &#8220;Little Chicago&#8221; or most commonly &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_District\">The Chicago of the North</a>&#8221; for good reason. At the turn of the century, Chicago and Winnipeg were rivals. Is that hard to believe? Before World War I, Winnipeg was the fastest-growing city in North America. By 1911 Winnipeg was the third-largest city in Canada. Winnipeg, like Chicago, was an international finance, industry, and transportation hub. From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, Chicago architects came to Winnipeg to practice their art and technique in buildings designs. They designed many buildings in the Exchange District. The Chicago architects&#8217; style influenced and inspired local Winnipeg architects, and the city kept growing in the Chicago style.</p>\n<p>One of the best examples of the Chicago style is the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> at 66 King Street. Personally, this building always made my imagination run towards early <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/\">Woody Allen</a> movies about New York, love, and love in New York. (Even though we’re talking about Chicago.) The building was designed by <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/atchison_jd.shtml\">J.D. Atchison</a>, a Chicago architect who moved to Winnipeg in 1905. Atchison designed nearly 100 buildings in the Exchange District area.</p>\n<p>I also want to highlight the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/confederationbuilding.shtml\">Confederation Life Building on Main Street</a>. I remember walking by that building, staring at its detail and marvelling at how much effort and creativity someone had to put into it. The Confederation Life Building was designed by a Toronto architect named <a href=\"https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=5950\">Wilson Gray</a>, who was influenced by Chicago style. This building is such an example of power, dignity, and strength that it takes your breath just for a moment. Next time you walk downtown and turn on Main Street, pay attention to the roof of the building. I promise, the details will surprise you, and perhaps inspire you to create something beautiful yourself.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3874\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Many locations in Winnipeg were inspired by the Chicago style. That’s why film directors do not hesitate to use Winnipeg streets as location sets when a plot includes scenes in 20th century Chicago. &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358135/locations\">Shall We Dance</a>,&#8221; with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, was shot in Winnipeg but set in Chicago. Just writing this makes me want to watch that movie again and point out all the familiar streets that now hold so many memories for me.</p>\n<p>Other common links between Winnipeg and Chicago are water and wind. Chicago is located on the shores of Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River; Winnipeg was born at the cross of the Assiniboine and Red rivers. Both cities are built on an open prairie area near a fresh water source. At the beginning of 20th century, Winnipeg was a transportation hub, with access to one of the longest rivers in Canada (the Assiniboine River stretches over 1,070 kilometres).</p>\n<p>Being built on open shores of lakes and rivers explains why both cities are known as windy cities. The average wind speed in Chicago is 16.6 km/hr, while Winnipeg wind speeds can reach 17.1 km/hr. If you think those are not big numbers, try to stand at the intersection of Portage and Main on a cold and windy February afternoon! Winnipeg’s wind speed is the second highest of any city in Canada, after Regina, Saskatchewan (18.4 km/hr). Chicago is also in second place, after Boston, Massachusetts (20.0 km/hr). On November 20, 1892, the Freeborn County Standard of Albert Lea, Minnesota, had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windy_City_(nickname)\">this to say</a> about Chicago being called the Windy City:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3880 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“But in another sense, Chicago is actually earning the title of the ‘windy’ city. It is one of the effects of the tall buildings, which engineers and architects apparently did not foresee that the wind is sucked down into the streets. Go ahead and walk past the Masonic Temple or the Auditorium. A day that may be perfectly calm elsewhere, will meet you with a lively breeze at the base of the buildings that will compel you to put your hand to your hat.”</p>\n<p>I’ve experienced exactly that many times while walking in downtown Winnipeg. The summer wind always tries to take my hats (but I always catch them, and lucky strangers get a laugh as I jog after my hat).</p>\n<p>Winnipeg, the Chicago of the North, has everything you need to take a trip back in time and land in 1905 Chicago. Chicago’s influence is all around: J.D. Atchison designed both the <a href=\"https://www.cmu.ca/\">Canadian Mennonite University</a>, the stunning <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank Building</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.virtual.heritagewinnipeg.com/vignettes/vignettes_039.htm\">Great-West Life building on Lombard Avenue</a>.</p>\n<p>The architecture in our city is beautiful and artistic; open your eyes, turn on your imagination, and maybe even look into the history of your favourite buildings. The effort is so worth it.</p>\n<p><em>Now, it is your turn to share!

I began my downtown living journey when I was 19, and I’ve never looked back. Something about downtown caught my interest when I was ready to move from my 130 square foot dormitory into a more grown-up apartment.</p>\n<p>As a young adult, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to create a life in an urban or suburban area. The wonderful thing about downtown Winnipeg is that combines the very best parts of Winnipeg into one neighbourhood! As the years advance and I shuffle between different downtown streets, downtown feels more and more like home.</p>\n<p>Whether you love parks, museums, music venues or creative attractions, downtown Winnipeg has something to make your heart sing. Downtown really optimizes its space with something interesting to see, eat and/or do around every corner.</p>\n<h3>A Mixture of Old and New</h3>\n<p>Downtown mixes the old and the new, showcasing Winnipeg’s attachment to its historical buildings by preserving them, scattered between modernized high rises. The older buildings are comforting and make downtown feel like more than just another concrete jungle. These mature buildings are one of the major reasons why I moved and stayed downtown; they’re full of stories of what Winnipeg used to be like, and how my grandparents and parents lived their lives in these streets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3318\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3318\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Archway at the Grain Exchange, Exchange District, Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-768x512.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1370x913.png 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway.png 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Archway at the Grain Exchange building, Winnipeg</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>You’re Never Hungry</h3>\n<p>Downtown serves as a melting pot, bringing together diverse people into one place—and it really shows through the food! There’s an assortment of eateries, which is great news for foodies like me. You can turn on to any street and be greeted by mom-and-pop bistros, one-of-a-kind cafes, or the familiar chain restaurants you can eat at just about everywhere (which I swear taste better downtown, for some reason). Food and I have a pretty steady relationship, and by living downtown I get the opportunity to experiment with all sorts of flavours!</p>\n<h3>Building Connections</h3>\n<p>Small town living has its romance, but urban living creates intense proximity between you and the people around you. It’s a common misconception that people who live in the heart of cities don’t interact with each other, but I beg to differ! You share laughs with the people at the bus stop as you joke about how Winnipeg Transit buses never seem to arrive on time, make small talk with the folks on the bus that you’re sardined against, groan along with people as you wait in the ridiculously long line at Tim’s, and smile at the person who held the elevator door open for you. These small but meaningful interactions make up the connections of downtown dwellers. You feel that connection because frankly, you can’t help it—you’re always in close proximity to someone.</p>\n<h3>The People Around You</h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that in some cities, downtown can seem cold and unwelcoming. However, I believe that the benefits of urban living can be seen in each unique neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood tells the story of the people who live there, and my neighbourhood downtown is full of people from all walks of life. In my apartment building, my neighbours include a family from across the pond who made me fresh juice when I moved in, an elderly man who gives everyone a Christmas card each year, and a few male university students who shovel the front walkway every winter without being asked. Maybe I’m lucky to know my neighbours, but with the hustle and bustle of downtown life, these types of people really shine a light on downtown Winnipeg’s unique spirit.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsx_u52AA8z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Both have cozy cafes promising your favourite latte, and moody bars serving creative and delicious cocktails. This is just a small taste of what the Exchange has to offer.

The Royal MTC was Canada’s first English Language regional theatre. It was created in 1958 by (then) Artistic Director <a href=\"http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Hirsch%2C%20John%20Stephen\">John Hirsch</a> and General Manager <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/hendry_tb.shtml\">Tom Hendry</a>—the two guys immortalized in the statue out front.</p>\n<p>Every season there are ten plays offered at either the Tom Hendry mainstage or the John Hirsch Warehouse.</p>\n<h3>Centennial Concert Hall</h3>\n<p>555 Main Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall/\">winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/loriwhelan/18158613780/in/photolist-tEBDeW-99y29b-99uRRp-99uSUx-99uRuM-99xZwY-99uU1V-99y1KS-99y2hs-99y2P5-99xZ9m\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/491/18158613780_147200b81f_c.jpg\" alt=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\nWhile it’s true the Brutalist architectural style makes the Centennial Concert Hall a divisive landmark, there’s no denying the importance of this building.

It’s changed since your elementary school field trip (though the bison diorama is still there to greet you). The Manitoba Museum offers a variety of exhibits and displays that appeal to kids and adults alike. The Science Gallery on the lower level invites hands-on experiments and race-car construction for kids. Take in a show at the Planetarium while you’re there. Even better, the museum now hosts after-hours events for adults. (Think tours with cocktails!)</p>\n<h3>The Mitchell Block</h3>\n<p>173 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.themitchellblock.ca/\">themitchellblock.ca</a></p>\n<p>Start off your night on a tasty note with dinner at the Mitchell Block. The menu changes frequently, but one thing you can count on is delicious homemade pastas and a warm ambience.</p>\n<p>If you’re wanting something lighter and more casual, the sister restaurant upstairs (<a href=\"https://www.wetanddrydept.com/\">Wet &amp; Dry Dept.</a>) offers cocktails and appetizers.</p>\n<h3>Forth</h3>\n<p>171 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">www.forth.ca</a></p>\n<p>Right next door from The Mitchell Block is Forth. This historic building was carefully renovated and has become one of the nicest spots in Winnipeg since it opened.</p>\n<p>The main floor has a café offering a well-curated menu of small bites to complement the coffee and drink menu.

Josh, better known amongst his peers as “@yoshigrams”, is dangling his feet from a rooftop in the historic Exchange District awaiting the first signs of light. His mission on this crisp September morning is to capture the first beams of sunlight as they rise to cascade over the array of brick buildings set in Chicago style. The aged brick buildings proudly display the remnants of hand painted ads and signs from years past. These ghosted-signed walls will serve as today’s backdrop. Sitting outside in the brisk weather patiently waiting for the sun’s first light is a small price to pay for the stunning photo he will capture today through the lense of his trusty and well-loved camera.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Josh is not alone in his mission to capture the city’s downtown core and the people calling it home. This group of talented and creative Winnipeg photographers, whether they know it or not, is quickly changing the way in which we view our city of just over 700,000 residents. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>For many, downtown Winnipeg has become a focal point and hub for photography thanks in part to its diverse cityscapes and character. A mix of late 1800s Chicago-style architecture that inhabits the Exchange, along with sporadic growth and revitalization in the downtown core, have all played a part in this resurgence of interest. New projects and spaces like <a href=\"http://www.truenorthsquare.com/\">True North Square</a>, <a href=\"https://humanrights.ca/\">Museum of Human Rights</a>, and the renovation of the <a href=\"https://www.wcc.mb.ca/\">Winnipeg Convention Centre</a> have captured the imagination of many–tourists and Winnipeggers alike. This diverse area encompasses approximately 179.18 square miles and is enjoyably explored on foot or bicycle. One can cover a large portion of the downtown area in a 15-minute bike ride or 20-minute walk from Portage and Main; that is all the distance separating the <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/eat-and-drink/dine/the-common\">Commons at the Forks Market</a> from the steps of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a> or the heart of the Exchange and Provencher Bridge.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_251\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-251\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-251 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Provencher-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-1024x576.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-768x432.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher.png 1267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Joe Lu</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>To what do we attribute this influx and growth of interest in photography?

While these all come into play, I think there’s something bigger and deeper at the heart of it all.

I can’t help but think that this friendly competition is the reason we are seeing such imagery evolving. While some may choose to shoot strictly on iPhones and others prefer investing in higher-end DSLRs, the well of creativity does not run dry. From romanticized skylines to whimsical street views. the variety of ways we can view our city has never been as interesting, as beautiful, or as diverse. This wave of both established and up-and-coming artists are transforming the mundane streets and views into beautiful works of art, ready to be hung on gallery and condo walls alike. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>And it is not just the aesthetic quality these photos possess, but the way in which they engage the viewer.

Leveraging tools like social media have forged new paths for us to journey along with photographers as they explore the downtown. Thanks to apps like VSCO and Instagram, we find ourselves consistently screenshotting images taken by some of our favourite Winnipeg photographers. It might be a simple reminder to order a print or, even more often, a reminder to add a specific location to our “To Do and See” list.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>On my phone amongst the clutter is an album labelled “To Do and See.” I enjoy photography, though I am far from accomplished; perhaps even labelling it a “hobby” is a statement of generosity.  But in the interests of inspiring other local, amateur photographers to grab their camera of choice and hit the pavement for adventure, I took a minute to map out one of my recent excursions.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_280\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRHsmeHAepw/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-280\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-768x959.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Manny Berkal-Sarbit @leggrease</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>From the steps of 300 Main, camera in tow, I hang a right and walk the 7 minutes to Via Rail Union Station to marvel at the building interior. I have been here before, but years ago when I did not have the appreciation I do now. Not many people know that the Historic Building built in 1908 through 1909 was designed by Warren and Wetmore, architects of New York’s Grand Central Station.  A few years back, an image of this space captured by Josh helped me to appreciate the intricate workings of the inner dome-shaped ceiling. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>I keep moving. Depending on the time of year and day, it looks like I am heading west to grab a couple of photos at Upper Fort Garry Park. I have driven by on a weekly basis for many years, yet I desire to take it in first-hand.  It’s hard to believe that more than 400 feet of steel and light went into the installation that scribe three continuous lines tracing the history of western Canada and of <a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/\">Upper Fort Garry</a>. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Time for some refreshment. I am sitting down for a drink at the Sky Lounge behind Hotel Fort Garry. Sky Lounge offers a stunning skyline view overlooking downtown and the Forks and is located just a few floors from Prairie 360, with views of the city in its entirety. If the day was still young I may rather have opted to grab a coffee at <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools + Horses</a> en route to lunch, served up on Broadway courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.theredember.com/\">Red Ember Food</a> truck just a block west from <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools + Horses</a>.  <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>At this point I have a few options. Option one, I can cross the street and do a self-guided tour of the Manitoba Legislative Building, hoping to adequately capture the extensive masonry work and do my best to make out the Hermetic Code written in stone (literally). Option two, I can walk up a block to hit the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/\">WAG</a>’s rooftop terrace or walk to the top of The Bay parkade across the street. These are some of the greatest vantage points of downtown and all it has to offer. Option three, I can venture North and check out the newly renovated Winnipeg Convention Centre (which has some awesome exterior textures and lighting) before sitting down in True North Square to do some skyward shooting. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>No matter which of these options I choose, I am then heading Northeast to continue the journey in the Exchange District. There I will capture some street scenes reminiscent of Chicago, some ghost signs that decorate the building landscape, and then stop for a bite at either <a href=\"https://www.kingandbannatyne.com/\">King + Bannatyne</a> or <a href=\"http://www.deerandalmond.com/\">Deer + Almond</a> before seeing who or what I can capture at the the Cube Stage in Old Market Square. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_267\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj2RcGZnbR9/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-267\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Mike Peters @93mp</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>My last route will be Waterfront Drive, making my way Southeast to capture <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/\">Shaw Park</a> with the arches of Provencher Street Bridge in the background. My final stop will be the ever-popular Museum of Human Rights. All said and done, I will have covered a good portion of downtown Winnipeg–Broadway–Assiniboine, South Portage, the Exchange District, Waterfront and the Forks. I will leave Central Park and Chinatown for my next adventure. All these places and spaces appeared on my timeline at some point; and it was either the lighting or composition that caught my attention in a way I had not viewed before.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>As Winnipeg’s downtown continues its renaissance, city dwellers and tourists alike are rediscovering all it has to offer. A vibrant city requires an active heart; a central core. Winnipeg has always possessed this active heart, yet at some points in time the vital signs have been seemingly weak. When the city of Winnipeg refocused its vision back to making a beautiful and accessible downtown, Winnipeggers took note.
