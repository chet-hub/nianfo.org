Don’t hide from your culinary creativity because of a mess! Here are five ways to keep your kitchen from looking like a hurricane made landfall in your cupboards.</p>\n<h3>1. Learn to love your Tupperware</h3>\n<p>The dreaded Tupperware cupboard: we all have one. Despite the mysterious lids and tumbling bottoms, tackling this beast doesn’t need to be intimidating. For a smooth post-dinner clean-up, invest in a simple file organizer. Yes—the file organizer on your desk can be put to work in your kitchen, too. Slide lids in one organizer and containers in another to make packing up leftovers a cinch.</p>\n<h3>2. High rise</h3>\n<p>Don’t compromise your charming mug collection just because you’re short on storage. Get the most out of the space you have by thinking vertical! Adding a shelf riser is a quick fix that lets you store more by instantly turning one shelf into two. With all that extra space, why not see what <a href=\"https://www.tinyfeast.com/\">Tiny Feast</a> has in stock to add to your collection?</p>\n<h3>3. Stash away your sprays</h3>\n<p>The cupboard under the sink—also known as the “I’ll just throw it under there” shelf—is an organizing challenge. Finding that one particular kitchen cleaner can be easy with a little creativity: buy a tension rod (the kind you use to hang a shower curtain) and install it under the cupboard. Hook sprays on the rod to create more room on the bottom shelf for “unhangables,” such as garbage bags. For bonus points, pare your collection down to one or two earth-friendly alternatives from <a href=\"http://generationgreenwpg.com/\">Generation Green</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. Double-duty backsplash</h3>\n<p>When it comes to organizing your kitchen, don’t let space goes to waste. Lean a square of pegboard against the back wall of your kitchen counter. Simply insert hooks into the board and hang the tools you use most often to keep them handy. This customizable option can be used for measuring cups, spatulas, and even whisks.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_573\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-573\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-573 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hanging Cups, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-1370x2056.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-573\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Calum Lewis from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>5. Stickin’ your spices</h3>\n<p>Cooking a meal can feel intimidating when you’re fumbling through your cabinet of toppling jars, bags, and containers of spices. Head to the nearby dollar store to purchase small glass jars and magnets. With a little bit of hot glue, your made-for-the-counter jars can become fridge magnets. Fill them up with your favourite spices for an easy way to grab cinnamon or oregano while minimizing cabinet clutter.</p>\n<p>Storage spaces and gadgets don’t need to be used the way they were intended to be; with a bit of imagination, you can make your kitchen a welcoming place to whip up your favourite meals!

Did you know we’ve got our own Ukrainian cultural centre and museum at the edge of downtown? Oseredok has two floors of changing exhibits and a gift shop. The exhibits change every four to six weeks, so you can go back frequently to see new things. During my visit, the second floor held a charming array of quilts, pillows and other stitched items of art.</p>\n<p>The staff members I spoke to were friendly and answered all of my questions. The museum is small, so it’s a great place to go when you want a quick visit. And if you’re trying to save your pennies, good news: visiting Oseredok is free of charge!</p>\n<p>The centre also offers a few public workshops each year, including a chance to learn the art of egg painting at Easter time and how to cook food for Ukrainian Christmas.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>Oseredok is located at 184 Alexander Avenue East. Admission is free. Current visiting hours are Monday to Saturday, 10 am to 4 pm. You can check out the museum online at <a href=\"http://oseredok.ca/\">oseredok.ca</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame</a></h3>\n<p>If you decide to visit Oseredok, you might as well make it a two-for-one day! The</p>\n<p>Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame is just steps away, located in the sparkly new <a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Canada Games Sports for Life Centre</a>.</p>\n<p>Here, you can see some of Manitoba’s sports history and learn about our greatest athletes and sporting achievements. This is another small museum that’s perfect for an afternoon visit.</p>\n<p>The current exhibit looks at Manitoba sports through the decades, with a focus on athletes who also served in Canada’s military. This exhibit is to honour the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War. You’ll get the chance to read about our athletes (including Bobby Hull), view a nice array of sports memorabilia, and watch a video or two. The exhibits change about once per year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-623 size-full\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3702.png\" alt=\"Sport Manitoba, Sport for Life Centre\" width=\"710\" height=\"994\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702.png 710w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-500x700.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-214x300.png 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>The museum and the Canada Games Sports Centre for Life are located at 145 Pacific Avenue at the edge of downtown.

It’s a Victorian house built in 1895 that was occupied by one-time Manitoba premier <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/hugh-john-personal-and-career/\">Hugh John Macdonald</a>, who was also known for his family relations. (His father was Canada’s first prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm\">John A. Macdonald</a>.) Hugh’s family lived in the home until 1929. It was taken over and turned into a museum in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>You can take guided tours through the building, which shows off Victorian architecture and furnishings. It’s a great spot for history and architecture buffs, and the guides are knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. (Guided tours take 45 minutes to an hour)<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-637\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3756.png\" alt=\"Dalnavert Museum, Historic Site, Ancient, Classic Interior\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756.png 1008w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-500x357.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-300x214.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-768x549.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-960x685.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>My favourite reason for visiting Dalnavert is for the events they run throughout the year, especially at Christmas time!</p>\n<p>The museum has done <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/20/a-christmas-carol-reading\">readings of A Christmas Carol</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2017/12/15/its-a-wonderful-life-a-live-radio-play\">radio play version of It’s a Wonderful Life</a>. You can enjoy the festivities while nibbling baked treats and imbibing hot cider, mulled wine or hot chocolate. This year, they’re hosting several lecture series covering topics including <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/11/4/lecture-series-jane-austen-reading-series\">Jane Austen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/16/charles-dickens-the-man-behind-the-carol\">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/2/victorian-ghost-stories\">Victorian ghosts</a>. I attended a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2016/12/12/clue-at-the-museum\">Clue</a> board game night there last year, which featured talented actors playing out the murder scene in different rooms of the mansion!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If You Go</strong></em></p>\n<p>Dalnavert is located at 61 Carlton Street (south of Broadway). Winter visiting hours are Wednesday to Sunday, 12 pm to 4 pm. The hours change throughout the year, so check their website before you go. Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for students and seniors, and</p>\n<p>$4 for children. To find out what intriguing events they have coming up next, visit <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\">friendsofdalnavert.ca</a></p>\n<p>Important note: because they haven’t changed the original structure of the building, the second and third floors are not wheelchair accessible.</p>\n<h4><strong>These Aren’t The Only Museums Downtown!</strong></h4>\n<p>Oseredok, the Sports Hall of Fame and Dalnavert are just three of downtown Winnipeg’s lesser-known museums. There are others you can visit, such as the <a href=\"http://www.wpgrailwaymuseum.com/home.html\">Winnipeg Railway Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/police/Museum/default.stm\">Winnipeg Police Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg is so full of history, we pass by so many of these cultural gems each day without giving them a second glance. If you want to enjoy everything your downtown home has to offer, make sure to visit them!</p>\n<h4><em>Is your personal favourite missing from this list?

Both have cozy cafes promising your favourite latte, and moody bars serving creative and delicious cocktails. This is just a small taste of what the Exchange has to offer. To get you started, I’ve put together my own list of great things to see and do on both sides of the Exchange.</p>\n<h2>East Exchange Highlights</h2>\n<h3>Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre</h3>\n<p>174 Market Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/home.aspx\">royalmtc.ca</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_534\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-534\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpXpUM7n88L/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-534 size-full\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg.jpg\" alt=\"Sense and Sensibility, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Winnipeg Downtown, Show, Entertainment\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg.jpg 800w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Sense-and-Sensibility-by-mtcwinnipeg-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-534\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sense and Sensibility ? by @leifnorman</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Let the red neon light installation (it’s a Winnipeg landmark!) guide you to the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC). The Royal MTC was Canada’s first English Language regional theatre. It was created in 1958 by (then) Artistic Director <a href=\"http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Hirsch%2C%20John%20Stephen\">John Hirsch</a> and General Manager <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/hendry_tb.shtml\">Tom Hendry</a>—the two guys immortalized in the statue out front.</p>\n<p>Every season there are ten plays offered at either the Tom Hendry mainstage or the John Hirsch Warehouse.</p>\n<h3>Centennial Concert Hall</h3>\n<p>555 Main Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall/\">winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/loriwhelan/18158613780/in/photolist-tEBDeW-99y29b-99uRRp-99uSUx-99uRuM-99xZwY-99uU1V-99y1KS-99y2hs-99y2P5-99xZ9m\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/491/18158613780_147200b81f_c.jpg\" alt=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\nWhile it’s true the Brutalist architectural style makes the Centennial Concert Hall a divisive landmark, there’s no denying the importance of this building. The decadent interior hosts not only the <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra</a>, but the <a href=\"https://wnmf.ca/\">New Music Festival</a>, concerts, and a variety of speakers.</p>\n<h3>Manitoba Museum</h3>\n<p>90 Rupert Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/\">manitobamuseum.ca</a></p>\n<p><center><div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-460-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4\">http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4</a></video></div></center>Have you been to the museum lately? It’s changed since your elementary school field trip (though the bison diorama is still there to greet you). The Manitoba Museum offers a variety of exhibits and displays that appeal to kids and adults alike. The Science Gallery on the lower level invites hands-on experiments and race-car construction for kids. Take in a show at the Planetarium while you’re there. Even better, the museum now hosts after-hours events for adults. (Think tours with cocktails!)</p>\n<h3>The Mitchell Block</h3>\n<p>173 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.themitchellblock.ca/\">themitchellblock.ca</a></p>\n<p>Start off your night on a tasty note with dinner at the Mitchell Block. The menu changes frequently, but one thing you can count on is delicious homemade pastas and a warm ambience.</p>\n<p>If you’re wanting something lighter and more casual, the sister restaurant upstairs (<a href=\"https://www.wetanddrydept.com/\">Wet &amp; Dry Dept.</a>) offers cocktails and appetizers.</p>\n<h3>Forth</h3>\n<p>171 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">www.forth.ca</a></p>\n<p>Right next door from The Mitchell Block is Forth. This historic building was carefully renovated and has become one of the nicest spots in Winnipeg since it opened.</p>\n<p>The main floor has a café offering a well-curated menu of small bites to complement the coffee and drink menu. The basement has one of the coziest/moodiest bars in the city and there’s even a rooftop bar open in the evenings (weather permitting). You’ll find a cocktail list that’s more creative than what you might be used to.</p>\n<h3>Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park</h3>\n<p>Sometimes going for a walk is the best way to fall in love with an area. Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park bookend the East Exchange and offer lush greenspace and a way to “get away” without really going anywhere.</p>\n<h2>West Exchange Highlights</h2>\n<h3>Artspace Building</h3>\n<p>100 Arthur Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://art-space.ca/\">art-space.ca</a></p>\n<p>Like an apartment building with a bunch of cool tenants, this building is home to a diverse group of arts and culture organizations that make Winnipeg a better place.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://platformgallery.org/\">PLATFORM: Centre for Photographic + Digital Arts</a> to <a href=\"http://www.videopool.org/\">Video Pool</a>, you could spend a lot of time wandering Artspace’s halls.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out what <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/cinematheque/\">Cinematheque</a> is showing.</p>\n<h3>Old Market Square</h3>\n<p><span class=\"tribe-street-address\">133 Albert Street</span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/\">exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_556\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-556\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BoXeHtRHBDs/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-556\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Nuit Blanche, Old Market Square, The Cube, Exchange District, Downtown\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-768x959.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nuit Blanche at the Cube, Old Market Square by Liz Tran</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>It may seem like this patch of greenspace in the middle of the Exchange is too small to be a destination, but during the summer it&#8217;s a hub for music, drama and the arts.</p>\n<p>In June, the TD Winnipeg International <a href=\"https://www.jazzwinnipeg.com/\">Jazz Festival</a> hosts free outdoor stage concerts. In July, the <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfringe.com/\">Winnipeg Fringe Festival</a> and the <a href=\"https://srfwpg.blogspot.com/\">Soca Reggae Festival</a> take the stage. In August you can enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.memefest.ca/\">Manitoba Electronic Music Festival</a>. Between these events you’ll see plenty of people making use of the space and making Old Market Square a central location for hanging out downtown.</p>\n<h3>Boutique Anya</h3>\n<p>88 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.boutiqueanya.com/\">boutiqueanya.com</a></p>\n<p>Stop by this stylish and minimalist boutique to pick up something to wear for your night out. Anya has pieces you won’t find anywhere else in Winnipeg.</p>\n<h3>Tiny Feast</h3>\n<p>217 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.tinyfeast.com/\">tinyfeast.com</a></p>\n<p>This store has the notebook you didn’t know you needed. “Tiny Feast” is a phrase the owners coined; a metaphor that’s used to “describe a variety of things that feel celebratory, lavish, almost extravagant—yet are intrinsically simple and useful, and therefore justifiably attainable on a personal, everyday level.” Stationery, gifts and other interesting items, shopping here is a feast in which you should indulge.</p>\n<h3>Cordova Tapas and Wine</h3>\n<p>93 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://cordovatapas.bar/\">cordovatapas.bar</a></p>\n<p>This intimate space has an extensive (and delicious) wine and tapas menu. What could be better than enjoying a glass of wine and a few one-bite dishes with friends?</p>\n<h3>Natural Cycleworks</h3>\n<p>91 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"http://naturalcycle.ca/cycleworks/\">naturalcycle.ca/cycleworks</a></p>\n<p>Down the flight of stairs at 91 Albert Street you’ll find one of the best bike shops in the city. This worker co-op (the people who work there also own it) has been around for a long time—and they know bikes. Natural Cycleworks offers full bike service year-round, custom built bikes, and is committed to recycling and resource conservation. With all those fancy new bike lanes in our downtown, this is your place to get geared up for a ride.</p>\n<p>Living downtown provides you quick access to Winnipeg’s vibrant arts and culture scene. The Exchange District, whether East or West, is brimming with new and fantastic things to taste, see and experience.</p>\n<p>This is my list—what’s yours?

And it’s a well-deserved crown. The Jets have earned a reputation as being one of the best teams in the <a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/\">National Hockey League</a>. With young stars such as Patrik Laine, Nikolaj Ehlers, Mark Scheifele, Kyle Connor and Connor Hellebuyck making headway, this can’t-miss team has been drawing not only national, but world-wide attention for their fast and fluid style of hockey.</p>\n<p>It’s an expensive night out if you plan on taking a date to a Winnipeg Jets game, but it’s usually worth it. In the heart of downtown, there’s no bigger gem than the beautiful Bell MTS Place. Built in 2004 and standing on the former Eatons site, the arena is owned by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, a company which also owns the Winnipeg Jets. They put out a product that is highly entertaining to watch night in and night out; you’ll leave with no regrets.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has a long and rich history of being a serious-minded hockey town, dating back to the early days of the sport when the Winnipeg Victorias won three Stanley Cups in the early 1900’s. Later, in 1920, the Winnipeg Falcons (a team of Icelanders from the West End of town) captured the first-ever Olympic gold medal in ice hockey. It’s only fitting that Winnipeg would erect an enormous hockey arena and stadium right in the centre of its downtown. You can’t be a downtown Winnipegger without taking in at least one Jets game this season.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/recreation-services/duckworth-centre/index.html\">University of Winnipeg—Duckworth Centre</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sangudo/8439115766/in/photolist-dRJF6Y-9Y9KHn-8N7bE8-pVgMqQ-qiT7fm-8dzhLc-owCXRK-9zXNdZ-5WvkZg-ouZHKh-p1RBK8-GsTV7z-q2LE7K-asqBwD-qcz3eT-a1udwZ-ox6TwZ-9Y9D7H-q2uqwa-qaCqU7-9XTmYj-FoWbn-RVuq7V-ofzeaT-q2NkLa-odPGow-FtxtW2-q2Nzve-q2u6Za-qKB2un-oeZ38t-qj3q7e-6TjfKJ-89DAkC-pnaM8a-bHRS2T-pmW7io-6TepQT-oy9MRD-8CAxv7-pmXsGs-pnc2Mt-6TiMnJ-ouCk85-6K5hs2-qcqveo-owqCk4-YoJBW6-pnrSnh-KCiTZW\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8439115766_bcb1f4d59b.jpg\" alt=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>At the University of Winnipeg campus on Portage Avenue you’ll find the beautiful Duckworth Centre, home to the University of Winnipeg’s Wesmen basketball and volleyball teams.

It’s within walking distance of downtown at 400 Spence Street and is a stop on most of the major bus routes (should the weather be frigid).</p>\n<p>Duckworth Centre is the University of Winnipeg’s premiere athletic facility. It features a large gymnasium which includes volleyball and basketball courts, a fitness centre with an indoor running/walking track, multiple racquetball/squash/handball courts, saunas, and much more.

It’s one of the oldest curling clubs in the world and certainly the oldest in Western Canada.</p>\n<p>Affectionately known to curling fans as the &#8220;Mother Club&#8221;, the Granite has produced countless Canadian and world champions. The original Granite Curling Club dates all the way back to 1880. In its current downtown location, the Tudor-framed clubhouse was built in 1913 and is recognized as an official historic site of Manitoba. It is often considered to be the &#8220;St. Andrews&#8221; of curling because of its contribution to the sport in curling&#8217;s mecca.</p>\n<p>If you have a free winter evening and you’re a sports fan looking for something to do, stop on by the Granite and have a drink, watch some curling and have a good time! If you like what you see, sign up for a league and try out the game for yourself. Did you know curling is making a comeback and is one of the fastest growing sports in the prairies? Join the enthusiasm and wrangle in some friends to join a team with you.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/\">Winnipeg Goldeyes—Shaw Park</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/evilfoo/19716053528/in/photolist-w3eVPo-6Lnbv7-cGQoXf-cGQpeC-6ywTJt-cGQptu-eBz8S2-cGQmW3-cGQnwJ-4T86bw-MKkv3-59mv7D-574iVb-p9LAMF-4Amjpk-V5WJFu-o9oecJ-6DWAb5-7GFGnk-cGQiXj-6KrUpV-7mFcWn-oqT3gB-85wggY-cGQq6Q-orFMTB-cFrA7f-a5NTq8-cGQpGQ-6KvYBw-adpH4a-9VC2vz-6KrSQz-6KrXSz-6Ks4HX-22B4uKP-6y8QEt-6KrYkM-56Z8Gx-cGQqUN-6xRZqe-6vJdFJ-3gfQAA-5jGq55-eCVFG6-6KwyN7-21wkAEy-orFMLH-ac8fPj-2kB35B\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/427/19716053528_cdc55240db_b.jpg\" alt=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" width=\"1024\" height=\"311\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>It’s hard to think of a better summertime sports option than watching a Winnipeg Goldeyes game over at Shaw Park. When tickets can be had for as little as $9, it’s a no-brainer for an evening of fun. Centrally located, adjacent to <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> (local beers and snacks of every ethnicity) and across the street from the <a href=\"http://Canadian Museum for Human Rights\">Canadian Museum for Human Rights</a>, you could even make a whole-day excursion out of a Goldeyes Game.</p>\n<p>While Winnipeggers (understandably) tend to fixate on the Jets and their standings, let’s take a moment to point out that the Goldeyes are one of the better baseball teams in the American Association, winning two league championships in the past three years. Even if you’re not an outspoken baseball fan, it’s worth your time just to see former MLB slugger Reggie Abercrombie hit some homeruns for the Goldeyes.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered why they’re called the Goldeyes, anyway? Here’s a piece of sports trivia: The club is named after the goldeye, a fish often served as a smoked delicacy and commonly called Winnipeg Goldeye. So why not take in a Goldeyes’ game and then smoke up some goldeye when you get back to your apartment after the game? That’s the make of a true Winnipegger.</p>\n<p>That’s only the beginning of the list of downtown stops for Winnipeg sports enthusiasts. Comment on your favorite spot for sports in downtown Winnipeg.

City lights, coffee shops, boutiques, food trucks, and skyscrapers; images of “urban” materialize in your mind when conversation turns to “downtown lifestyle.” It could even be the idea of walking to your workplace instead of being stuck in traffic that sways you to move into the heart of the city.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>However, when you’ve finally made the dream come true and you are living right in the center, there appears another question: How will you decorate your new apartment? How can you make this space a reflection of who you are and who you want to be? For your guests, how can your apartment be comfortable, modern and inviting? The challenge is to create a space you look forward to coming home to at the end of a day, and to like it enough that you feel free to invite in friends, family and neighbors.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Living in a small apartment doesn’t mean your space has to be boring. If you are living in downtown Winnipeg’s Exchange District, you are already surrounded by some of the most historic and beautiful architecture in Western Canada. Looking out of your window every morning is your first source of inspiration for your downtown apartment décor! <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Let me give you a few more sources of inspiration. Here are <em><b>seven easy tips to decorate your apartment with style.</b></em></p>\n<h3><b>1. Decide what you want to say through the interior design of your apartment</b>.</h3>\n<p>Our houses show the world who we are just as our clothing does. It is said, “Dress to impress. Dress for success.” I would also say, “Dress up your house so people can know who you are and what you’re about.” I love looking at the small details of someone’s home. Books on shelves, pictures on walls, and decor from foreign countries can tell a lot about the dweller. How do you want people to feel or what do you want them to know about you when they walk into your apartment? “He must be a musician, I see sheet music all around and a guitar right there in the corner”; or “I love those strict and simple lines of his furniture. He must be a pragmatic and realistic person.” When I lived in a small studio in downtown Winnipeg, I placed an open easel right beside the window along with oil colors and canvases. I didn&#8217;t have to say a single word to my guests about who I am or what I value. They could see a creative woman living in that studio just because an easel was a part of the interior.</p>\n<p><center> <a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/514888169892992854/\"></a> </center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Minimalism, modern, boho…step number two is to <b>decide on the style</b>.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>There are many sources of inspiration for new style ideas. However, before you start browsing the internet and designer magazines, make a list of what you like. Try to list colors, shades, lines and textures. Your perfect home—what does it look like? Does it have darker or lighter furniture? Would you prefer surrounding yourself with books, pillows and candles, or do you feel more relaxed in an empty and open space? <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>When your list seems complete, it’s time to start browsing. You need to describe the desired style in one word. Why? Let me give you an example based on minimalistic style. You decided that Scandinavian minimalism makes your heart beat faster. When your eyes rest on perfect wooden details, grey couches, potted plants in nooks and on sills, you are in love. This Scandinavian minimalism will become your base. White, grey and cold dusty blue will be the palette for this minimalistic style. Interior design has the same building techniques as clothing capsule; you will build, add, and create from your base. When you have a strong base, incorporating items and accessories from a different style won’t ruin your look; the spirit of your space will remain the same.</p>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/114630753000986248/\"></a></center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>3. Mix them all up!</b></h3>\n<p>In step two, you’ve done the hard work of finding one style to act as a strong base. Step three is more fun! If you want to add more life, more chic, and a professional-looking vibe to your place &#8211; mix styles. You might have a very simple grey couch in minimalistic style, but the coffee table, rugs, and wall prints are funky in a creative or modern style. Mix modern and classic, urban and traditional; many interior designers use this method. It helps breathe a sense of life into a space.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Add textures.</b></h3>\n<p>Even the most minimalistic person with the most minimalistic interior design would love to cuddle up under a warm throw on a cold winter evening. Texture adds comfort. Look for textured pillows, curtains, blankets and rugs. Textured curtains with a print mounted close to the ceiling can be a great way to add some visual height to apartment walls. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/275634439666792944/\"></a></center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>5. Don’t forget</b><b>memorable pieces or vintage details</b>. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>What I love most about Winnipeg is the antique stores and flea markets. Among other interesting items, I have found 1920’s picture frames, extravagant lamps, and even an umbrella holder. Antique stores and flea markets are full of hidden gems that have the power to make your place look special. We’ve all been in a house or apartment that presents the finest furniture, yet it feels plastic and fake. There is no spirit of home. These houses do not reflect the owner’s vision; on the contrary, those expensive, perfect pieces of furniture only bring with them an impersonal feeling of coldness. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If you, on the other hand, are the owner of a basic, simple couch, what is the trick to making your place look and feel interesting and inviting? Try displaying vintage photo frames with pictures of your happy self or your cat (or better yet&#8211;you with your cat!), or the people most important in your life. If vintage details are not your thing, do the opposite. Allow yourself to splurge on just one unique and funky looking piece of furniture, a piece which will express your style and personality. It might be a sofa chair with curved legs, or a set of bar chairs offering an unusual shape, shade or aesthetic detail. Don’t shy away from bringing interesting pieces into your life. Have fun creatively incorporating into your décor items that are particularly meaningful to you; pieces with history or which have a story to tell.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>6. Add </b><b>color </b><b>accents.</b> <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Living in Winnipeg with its long, cold winters has its effect on our visual appetite. We crave bright colors time after time. The best way to bring more color into your daily life is through intentionally incorporating richly-colored accents and prints into your interior design. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>I love colorful pillows in my living room. When the seasons change, I change my pillows from mustard yellow to crisp, bright blue. Colors make a room look different. (Though I would recommend keeping your walls white or light grey to make the room appear more spacious.) Adding colorful pillows<b> </b>here and there can make any gloomy and snowy day seem better.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>7. Maximize space</b><b>.</b></h3>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/325525879309312118/\"></a></center><br />\nLiving in a smaller space can be challenging in the way of finding storage solutions for your stuff and protecting your place from feeling or becoming overcrowded. Bring more air into any room by minimizing the clutter. Clutter could include things like overloaded piles of papers, too many countertop appliances in the kitchen, or even chairs around a table that are too close to each other. To instantly make your apartment feel more spacious, rearrange furniture pieces so they have at least two steps between them. You’ll be amazed at what this simple trick can do.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If I could leave only one parting tip, it would be this: Don’t be scared to be bold and brave. Life is too short to decorate your home with boring furniture. To prove it, I just purchased a yellow couch. That’s right, a yellow one! And I’m not turning back.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><script async defer src=\"//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js\"></script></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living in a small apartment doesn’t mean your space has to be boring. If you are living in downtown Winnipeg’s Exchange District, you are already surrounded by some of the most historic and beautiful architecture in Western Canada.

Take a moment and peek into your garbage can. For every fruit or vegetable scrap, eggshell, pile of coffee grinds or pizza crust you see, give yourself a point. For this game we’re playing by golf rules: the lower the points, the higher the score. How did you do?</p>\n<p>Food scraps comprise a large portion of Canadian waste-bin space, but they don’t belong there! Don’t let being an apartment dweller prevent you from composting and living your best eco-friendly life.</p>\n<p>Don’t know where to begin? Here are some quick and easy tips on how you can gain your environmental karma back.</p>\n<h4>Worm Bin</h4>\n<p>For most urban renters, a compost bin is probably the best solution. Worm compost bins are one of the most resourceful compost options available for apartment dwellers. The worm method is portable and quick, as worms help process your household waste and produce nutrient-rich “worm-tea”—a beneficial addition to the soil of your household plants.</p>\n<h4><em>DIY Worm Compost Bin</em></h4>\n<p>Purchase a medium to large plastic bin with two lids: one for the top and the other to place under the bottom. Poke a few, scattered holes in the bottom of the bin for drainage, and a few holes in the top of the lid for ventilation. Place the second lid underneath the bin to catch liquid.</p>\n<p>Now onto the wiggly night-crawlers.</p>\n<p>You can purchase worms in various places around Winnipeg: your local garden centre, a vermicomposting facility (<a href=\"http://www.naturesperfectplantfood.com\">www.naturesperfectplantfood.com</a>), or even <a href=\"https://www.kijiji.ca/\">Kijiji</a>, just to name a few. To make the bin feel like home for the worms, soak the bin with water and line the sides and bottom of the bin with shredded newspapers. Lastly, spread a little soil over the paper and plop in those slimy fellas.</p>\n<p>Now that you have prepared the compost bin, you can begin throwing in your food scraps. To avoid odors and to guarantee more efficient composting, be sure to continue adding more damp newspaper strips, leaves and/or dirt along with your scraps.</p>\n<h4>Compost Bin Without the Worms</h4>\n<p>If you’re not fond of worms, you need not include them! Follow the steps above and simply omit the worms; just be prepared for the food to take a bit longer to break down.</p>\n<h4><em>Where to Store your Bin</em></h4>\n<p>Determine the best place for you. Common locations are under the sink, in an infrequently used closet, on the balcony, or even in a window flower box.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_405\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-405\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-405 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1370x913.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-405\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4>Freezer Composting</h4>\n<p>The benefit of keeping compost in your freezer is that you don’t have to worry about maintaining the compost bin and it’s out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>Slide that tub of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream and that freezer-burned hamburger meat to one side to clear up some space. You can use brown paper bags, compostable plastic bags or a freezer-safe jar or tub. This composting solution is great for dropping your food waste straight from the chopping board.</p>\n<p>The only downside to this alternative is that you’ll be taking more trips to dispose of your composting drop-off.</p>\n<h4><em>Where to Take Your Compost</em></h4>\n<p>Compost can be dropped off at various locations around the city.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://greenactioncentre.ca/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-346 size-medium\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/green-action-centre-300x143.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/green-action-centre-300x143.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/green-action-centre.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Green Action Centre (<a href=\"http://www.greenactioncentre.ca\">www.greenactioncentre.ca</a>) provides a list of local places that accept compost waste; and if you’re really dedicated, Compost Winnipeg (<a href=\"http://www.compostwinnipeg.ca\">www.compostwinnipeg.ca</a>) offers home compost pick-up for a small fee.

Go ahead and throw those egg shells, coffee grinds, and fruit peels into the blender, add some water and let it rumble.</p>\n<p>You can easily dispose of this compost smoothie by adding small amounts to the soil of your indoor plants, or by pouring it into a flowerbed or soil patch near your apartment. With the onset of our traditional Winnipeg six-month winters, ask your friends or work colleagues if they have an outdoor compost bin you can use during the snowy months, or contact your local indoor greenhouses/gardens.</p>\n<p>Lastly, have fun with composting! Don’t think of it as a chore. It will soon become routine, just like separating your recycling from the rest of your garbage. You just may inspire your other apartment-dwelling friends and neighbours to take on an eco-friendlier lifestyle.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Food scraps comprise a large portion of Canadian waste-bin space, but they don’t belong there!

You’re in the heart of the city with oodles of entertainment choices right outside your door. In your new digs at 300 Main, you will also have new neighbours, maybe more than you’ve ever had before. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>As adults, we sometimes have trouble making new friends and even introducing ourselves to others. Do you want your neighbours to be more than just nameless faces but don’t know where to start? If so, here are five ideas that just may get you started in meeting those sharing your new living environment. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Join the Gym</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>At 300 Main, you’ve got some swanky new amenities, including a gym. There are many good reasons to use these facilities, the most obvious of which are exercise and healthy living. Yes, you could work out in your apartment, but you won’t meet anyone new there. The gym will give you an opportunity to politely check out and maybe meet some of your neighbours. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1438523886290140&#038;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></center></p>\n<p>It can be easier to introduce yourself to someone in the gym, because you already have something in common: a desire to exercise. This gives you a ready-made topic to discuss. Does your possible new bestie have a favourite piece of equipment or a good workout tip? Starting with this type of safe topic gives you a chance to chat and discover if you might have more in common. If they don’t seem like buddy material, stick to your short exercise chat, then go back to working out. Having exercise to do gives you an easy excuse to extract yourself from a conversation that isn’t going well. (The introverted among us always like having an escape plan from awkward conversation.) Remember, less is more. You don’t want to be the pushy type, so don’t monopolize anyone for too long.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If your first conversation goes well, you can try to catch this person on the regular at the gym for a while. If you both seem receptive to talking outside of the gym, suggest going for drinks or coffee, something comfortable and short.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Friends-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Friends-1370x913.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>Join a Social Event or Start a Social Committee</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-225\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-500x374.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-300x224.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-768x574.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/blue-charity-cheerful-1208694-1370x1024.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />Does your building hold any social events onsite or organize any group outings? If yes, consider joining one that interests you. If you don’t see any options for social gatherings, consider starting a social committee yourself. You will likely need to talk to building management first, but group outings are another great way to meet people in low-stress situations and see if you have something in common.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>You can also join or start a charitable endeavour in your building. There are many non-profit organizations located downtown, such as<i> Siloam Mission</i><i> </i>or<i> Welcome Place</i>, which have volunteer openings.  Alternatively, you could invite your apartment block or floor to raise money as a community. Organizations like the Christmas Cheer Board are always looking for new donors. Any of these options will create an opportunity for you to meet people and help a worthy cause at the same time. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Start a Conversation in Common Areas</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Inevitably, you will see some of your new neighbours in the hall, on the elevator or in the mailroom. One of the easiest ways to meet your neighbours is to pipe up and introduce yourself in these situations. If you’re an extrovert, starting conversations with complete strangers is likely an easy task for you. If you’re an introvert, this will take more effort. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Start with a smile and avoid coming on too strong. Remember, you’ve already got something in common: you live in the same building! Ask what they think of the building, the gym or some other amenity. This should lead to an easy conversation. Chances are good you can converse on this topic for a few minutes, which is all you will have (at most) when you randomly run into people in your building. Remember to give your name and, if you feel comfortable, what floor you live on. You won’t hit it off with every neighbour, so don’t fret if the first few conversations don’t work out. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Advanced Technique</b><b>: Throw a Party!</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>If you’re a sociable sort and like to plan events, consider throwing a party. This might be especially welcome if everyone on the invitee list is new to the building, since most of us like to make friends. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>It’s best to invite a smallish number of people to a party, maybe everyone on your floor. You can knock on doors, leave messages under doors or invite people you’ve met and with whom you have already exchanged numbers.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Keep the event low key and don’t try to make people do party games. Be conscientious and keep the volume down. Not everyone will come and you don’t want to tick off the people who share your building. The party could just be an easy brunch (mimosas!) or after work drinks. You don’t have to plan for a six-hour event. If all goes well, you might make a few friends. At least you will have some friendly new acquaintances you can talk to when moving around your building.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Think</b><b> </b><b>Beyond Your Building</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\">It’s great to know people right in your living space, but you don’t have to limit yourself to one spot. Take advantage of your location to meet other downtown denizens. You can try local coffee shops or nightclubs. If you pick a regular time to visit your favourite coffee haunt, you might spot other regulars</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\"> and be spotted by them</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW892797\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW892797\">. It will be less intimidating to start conversations with people who have seen your face a few times.</span></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-187 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/meetup.en_-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-300x158.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-500x263.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-768x403.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-1024x538.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/meetup.en_-1370x719.png 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>You can also look for local organizations to join. There are multiple Toastmasters clubs that meet downtown. You can also check out <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">www.meetup.com</a> to find information about groups or events downtown that might interest you. You can visit the Millennium Library or sign up for some volunteer work in your neighbourhood. There are so many options for meeting people downtown. Pick one and take the plunge!<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>Starting Is Often the Hardest Part</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Meeting people and making new friends can take some work and some intentionality. Choose not to keep your head down over your phone when you’re in your building.  Show your neighbours you are open to connecting by smiling, making eye contact, and saying “hi” when you can. The truth is, many people are shy and just need an invitation to strike up a conversation.  Before long, you’ll discover that “renters” have become “neighbours”, and “neighbours” have become friends. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Downtown living can be exciting.
