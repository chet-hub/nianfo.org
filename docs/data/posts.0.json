So we made a quick pitstop to check out 300 Main on our way into the Exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located with bike lanes immediately behind the building and a bi-directional bike lane a block away, it’s easy peasy to get anywhere by bike from 300 Main.&nbsp; It was simple to stop for a quick visit to show my pals, and from there, we used the handy bike lane on Fort Street to connect us to the Exchange and on to our adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10480\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to our first Nuit Blanche stop, we took the Fort Street bike lane, which becomes a protected bike lane once you cross Portage Avenue.&nbsp; We took this to Adelaide Street, where we popped over to Arts Junktion.&nbsp; They were running a bike decorating spot, where you could also get your bike looked over by The Wrench.&nbsp; Now that our bikes and helmets were all decorated, we were ready for the rest of the night!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10481\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes to the Little Brown Jug Brewery Street party and were greeted with great tunes from DJs set up on their newly upgraded patio, food trucks along the closed street, and plenty of amazing beer.&nbsp; We went inside the brewery to check out their art installation, Moths to a Flame, by Warner Carther.&nbsp; Incorporating transparent glass and light projections, the entire space was lit up with flickering flames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to end the night back in the Exchange, which really is the main centre of Nuit Blanche, so from Little Brown Jug, we cycled up Adelaide Street to the McDermot Avenue bi-directional bike lane, then across Main Street to Stephen Juba Park, along Waterfront Drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10482\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-300x235.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-770x603.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-293x229.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two really great installations along the bike and walking path through Stephen Juba Park.&nbsp; The first we saw was Kasuri, located near the Mere Hotel and created by Takashhi Iwasaki &amp; Joe Kalturnyk.&nbsp; This was a fun, interactive light exhibit, where viewers could turn wheels at the side, which made central pieces move and float, like shimmering blue and pink helix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10483\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next stop was Elucida, created by Biom Lab.&nbsp; Elucida resembled beautiful, colourful patio lanterns strung between the large trees in the park.&nbsp; This effect was emphasized by a group that had set up patio chairs and were hanging out, occasionally chatting with passers by that they knew from the mass of people walking through.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10484\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes out from the thick of people and managed to get a nice little ride along the fenced bike path that leads under the Esplanade Riel Bridge.&nbsp; We stopped at the foot of the bridge, behind the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, to take in Ikuma by Geronimo Inutiq, presented by the Winnipeg Art Gallery.&nbsp; Ikuma from Inuktitut translates to flame, fire, or spark, and this audiovisual program was fascinating to watch and listen to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10485\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many different installations and events taking place at The Forks for Nuit Blanche, and we checked out three of them.&nbsp; Homesick Angels by Joshua Banman, located at the CN Stage, was an interactive exhibit where the audience was projected onto a bank of vintage television sets, becoming angels with coloured halos, laser eyes, and flames in their hands.&nbsp; It was mesmerizing to watch and play with, as well as a little eerie and creepy due to the classical music playing softly at the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10486\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also saw Renaissance of Memory by Nayden, set up on the 5th floor of the parkade.&nbsp; With digital projections as well as little vignettes of tables, toys, and televisions dotted throughout the space, this was a fun piece to wander around and explore while contemplating memory, nostalgia, and sentimental longing for childhood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10487\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our final stop at the Forks was to see Bikes, Lights, Nights by Sputnik Architecture with bikes from the Plain Bicycle Project.&nbsp; The project created an upside-down world of suspended, multicolour, lit-up bicycles high in the tree canopy of the Forks Patio (to the left of the harbour, as you face the river).&nbsp; It was truly magical to see!&nbsp; This installation will run until the end of Culture Days, on October 16, so there is still some time to catch it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From The Forks, we zipped along the bike path that leads to Assiniboine Avenue, taking the bi-directional protected bike lane on Garry Street back to the Exchange District.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10488\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To say the Exchange was packed would truly be an understatement!&nbsp;

But don&#8217;t give up on growing just yet! This article is filled with outdoors space ideas for small gardens to be in full bloom in no time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to make do with gardening off my balcony, thinking once I gave up having a yard and garden, I would have to put the trowel away for good, but it turns out there are lots of fun and innovative ways to get a beautiful garden in any space!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Planters</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10430\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden1.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the many challenges of having a smaller outdoor area to garden with is you might have lots of space and are not sure how to use it. If you don&#8217;t have a yard and are working off a balcony like many urban gardeners, you will need to get creative. The type of planters you get makes all the difference in your working space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Railing Planters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best solutions for a balcony garden is to use the railing! When it comes to balconies or fenced-in yards, railing boxes are a great option. Not only does it give you a few more feet of planting space than you already thought you had, but it also looks great and provides some shade and privacy from your neighbors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can plant just about anything in a railing planter box, herbs, vegetables, vines, or flowers; most plants will do great in this type of planter, especially under the direction of your green thumb.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hanging Planters</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10432\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden2-631906d8c8779.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great small space solution for your plating needs is hanging baskets and plants. Many plants already come with a hanger; if they don&#8217;t, most of them could thrive in them! Hanging baskets are a great way of utilizing the space above and around you, especially if you have to have most of your plants on a balcony or inside. <a href=\"http://verdeplantdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hanging plants</a> look great and do great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Upside Down Plants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know there are a wide variety of plants you can grow upside down? This has been a trending method for small gardens. Many plants will do great upside down, and you can even get tomatoes, strawberries, and other plants that are already meant to grow that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vertical Gardens</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10433\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden3.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A vertical garden is a terrific alternative if you are low on railing or spaces to hang. These are great because you can customize them to your space and your plants. Many plants grow up rather than spreading out and would do very climbing a pallet, lattice, or even railing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Indoor Greenhouse</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have any space to work outside, one of the best options is to have an indoor greenhouse instead! You can customize these to your space or even order them online for less than $100. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indoor greenhouses are controlled spaces to let you grow a wide variety of plants. These are already a popular choice for moving plants from outside to inside for the winter and are great for year-round growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Container Gardening</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10434\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden5.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this one may seem like a no-brainer, but something you can do no matter the space you have to work with is container gardening. You don&#8217;t have to need to do a lot of digging, hanging, and stressing about how to grow plants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to fill any space with plants is to grow them individually rather than in a garden. You can get creative and use anything from containers to old shoes to plant in; this way, you are filling your space with what it can thrive with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lighting &amp; Watering</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding gardening, it is important to keep the lighting of the space inside and outside. You want to pick plants that are good for your light situation. If you are in an indoor space or your balcony doesn&#8217;t get direct full sun, then you want to make sure you choose mid to low-light plants. If you want to grow things that require more natural light than your situation offers, there are many ways to give your plants what they need so they thrive in any environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/noma-full-spectrum-led-grow-bulb-a19-0529642p.html?ds_rl=1283573&amp;ds_rl=1283573&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyOuYBhCGARIsAIdGQRMPDxNkezoUBWZoblwettbZwdZ23PPhyCzCK4egD2YlmQpEuY_4oKAaAuwVEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#store=223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">grow bulbs</a>&#8221; from even the dollar store to give them the UV specifications they need. Another great solution is if you already have a UV lamp (or SAD lamp); these work great for giving your plants that extra boost of sunshine they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1024x674.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10435\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-300x198.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-770x507.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-293x193.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6-1400x922.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/garden6.jpg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You also want to make sure that you are watering them enough and not too much.

Feel free to substitute and improvise wherever you might need to. Things like milk, yogurt, protein powder, and other ingredients may be allergy or diet-sensitive, so just use whatever you typically use when it comes to dairy and protein.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10348\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog2.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply swap in your usual milk, yogurt, and protein powder, and feel free to throw in your favorite ingredients anywhere!

Throwing in vitamins you might need more of like C, D, B12, and Omega 3 is a great way to add a nutritional boost to your day and overall health.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10349\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/08/blog3.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These recipes are sure to help you make the most of the best flavors that summer offers, rich in vitamins, minerals, and seasonal summery flavors that you&#8217;ll want year-round.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Greenville</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Greenville is a healthy play on a delicious favorite, the creamsicle!

Located near Winnipeg and with so much to do, Birds Hill makes for a great day trip or weekend of camping.

Covering over 2000 square kilometers, this section of the province is about 2 hours from Winnipeg, close to the Manitoba &#8211; Ontario border. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10189\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-lukas-1309584-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has many popular spots and different options for camping. From cabins to private tent pitching, there is an experience for every kind of camper, from the camper to the glamper. Some of the best campsites in the Whiteshell area are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Westhawk Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Westhawk lake is famous for its unique origin story. The lake was the result of a meteorite crash at this location long ago, which ended up giving Manitoba its deepest lake at 115 km. Westhawk lake is a great spot to camp. It has many campsites close to the lake with water, electricity, and nearby shops and food; Westhawk is a very comfortable camping experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10190\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-uriel-mont-6271390-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason why Westhawk is so popular is it is attached to its neighbor, Caddy Lake, but you will have to go through some pretty captivating tunnels to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Caddy Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Caddy Lake is a beautiful place to go camping, especially for the active camper, as it is connected to Westhawk Lake by a series of tunnels. You might need a kayak, canoe, or boat to get to and around the lake and campgrounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10191\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-quang-nguyen-vinh-2582818-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are planning on camping or visiting Caddy Lake, it is well worth the trip. Once you are there, you have the choice of some nice, more secluded campsites near the lake or within hiking distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Falcon Lake</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Falcon Lake is another long-time Manitoba favorite when it comes to camping. Also, within the Whiteshell provincial park and less than a 2-hour drive from Winnipeg, Falcon Lake is one of the most popular campgrounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"766\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10192\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025.jpg 766w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/06/pexels-matthew-devries-2526025-293x196.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring RV and tent campsites complete with electricity, water, showers, playgrounds, and most of which are within walking distance to the beach. Camping isn&#8217;t all there is to do while you are at Falcon Lake with its nearby town of shops, restaurants, and even a golf course.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Otter Falls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nestled up in Manitoba&#8217;s own boreal forest along the Winnipeg River, only an hour and a half from Winnipeg, is Otter Falls.

To your dog, anything can be a potential threat, and barking is their only alarm. Especially when you are living in an apartment, one of the main reasons your dog barks is random noises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To dogs who are sensitive to noise and vibrations, loud neighbors, other animals, kids, and random noises that come with the everyday life of apartment living probably sound a little bit like a purge until you see what is really going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 5 Basic Steps to Successful Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important not to discipline your dog every time they bark, but teach them when and how to instead. You can use these steps to train your dog for almost anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9940\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to have your dog bark trained is by teaching them how to bark properly. Once your dog realizes there is a time and a place for barking, they will start to bark less at seemingly everything. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The 5 Steps to Training Your Dog are:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Observe (The Reaction)</li><li>Introduce (The Sound)</li><li>Replace (Reaction with Command)</li><li>Reward &amp; Repeat</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Observe</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by observing what triggers your dog barking so you can plan what you need to work on. It&#8217;s likely your dog is triggered by the same noises every time so take note of what you need to train your dog on and work on those areas specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Introduce</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next is to introduce your dog to the sound so they can understand where it is coming from. Much of the time, dogs are barking out of curiosity, and you can help them stop barking at the same things in the future by teaching them what the sounds are. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9941\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your dog is triggered by noise in the hall, let your dog watch what is making the noise. If your dog barks at people in the hallway, it is helpful to try and let your dog meet as many of your neighbors as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likely your pet barks at your next-door neighbors the most since they&#8217;re the closest, and your dog can&#8217;t always tell if it&#8217;s their door or yours. So, if your neighbor and your dog are both friendly, try a meet and greet as they&#8217;re coming and going so your dog gets familiar with them and stops barking at them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Training Exercise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that your dog is familiar with the white noise and people of your building, start training them on the sound of your next-door neighbors if that&#8217;s a problem area for your dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have your neighbor leave and come back and work on how your dog reacts. When your dog starts to react to the noise of your neighbor, start by getting your dog to sit and work up to add in your own &#8216;no barking command&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9942\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When your dog hears them and starts to react, get them to sit and stay. Open your door, so your dog can associate the sound with the person. Now that your dog knows that the sound of the keys in the lock next door is just your friendly neighbor who isn&#8217;t a threat, they will start barking less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat the exercise; this time, don&#8217;t open the door right away. Ask your dog to sit and use your no-barking command to get the dog to sit and try to be quiet before opening the door. Your dog probably knows who is on the other side of the door if you do this a few times in a row, so it is important to do this outside of your training exercise as well. As your dog starts to change his reactions, keep refreshing the training and rewarding their efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Barking at Your Door</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next situation you want to train your dog in is when there is a knock on your door. Since your dog thinks he is doing his job by reporting every noise to you, it is important to teach him which noises to look out for and how to react to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9946\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have observed how they are reacting and you have decided how you want them trained, it&#8217;s time to work on replacing their barking with that reaction instead. Training is most effective if you can dedicate time out each day for your dog where you are going to work on the specific things, rather than just trying to correct the behavior as it pops up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you want to do is get their attention by having them sit. Once they&#8217;re sitting, work on getting them to stop barking using your designated command. Reward them for sitting and for any efforts made to stop barking at your word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have them trained to stop barking on command try to repeat the situation a<a href=\"https://www.petsmart.ca/dog/treats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nd reward them for stopping a few times in a row</a>. Try to avoid calling your dog badly, focus on rewarding for changed behavior instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark5-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9948\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In time, your dog will learn to ignore the noises entirely. Once your dog is more used to everything and you start training, you can begin to train them on how they are barking at your company and at you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Knock Training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to train them on is knocks on the door. A big reason why dogs bark is they think you or someone else is at the door. So, you want to teach them how to tell the differences and how you want them to act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way of doing this is with knock training for when the company is at the door and for when you are coming home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When It&#8217;s Company</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a friend stand on the other side of the closed door with you and your dog inside. Have them knock on the door, and you train your dog on how you want them to react to someone knocking on the door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, you want to start with training them to sit and get them to stop barking using their newly taught word.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark8-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9947\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Observe</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your friend to knock, and you observe your dog&#8217;s reaction, try to resist intervening or saying a command, and wait out until they are done, if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Introduce</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduce your dog to what is making the sound. Show your dog that it is actually someone at your door that they are responding to. Don&#8217;t open the door but acknowledge that your dog is alerting you about someone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you want to get them to sit and if you can, stop barking using your word before you open the door. If they still are barking, continue training.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Replace</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you want to do is replace the reaction with what you are teaching them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat your friend knocking and your dog sitting with rewards a few times in a row. Once they are sitting for you, as a reaction, you can teach them a command to go with it that tells them to stop or not to bark when there is a knock at the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark9-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9945\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Have your friend knock again, and when your dog barks, have them sit and tell them the command. Encourage them to stop barking with that command and once your dog stops barking, say the command and praise them, so they associate the word with being quiet and being quiet with praise and reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Repeat &amp; Reward</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some dogs pick it up right away; others may need a few more training days or weeks. It is important to keep training consistent until your dog does get it before they start to go back to their old behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/7-fun-ways-to-celebrate-halloween-with-your-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dogs respond much better to praise and reward</a>.

If your dog feels like you are getting angry at them for barking, this may make your dog&#8217;s barking or other reactions worse and harder to train.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9944\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continue to praise them for the following days to a couple of weeks while they are still fresh with it. Remember, when it comes to changing behavior like barking with your dog, consistency, praise, and patience are key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your dog is only as smart as you make them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training your dog how to react when it is you helps them tell the difference between strangers and you when they are home alone. This will help your dog be more relaxed towards people in the hallway passing by and your neighbors coming and going while you are out as it teaches your dog to recognize when you are home and when it&#8217;s just someone passing by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that your dog is only as trained as you let them be. Every dog is different. There is no magic number of times or amount of time until your dog is totally trained in this way. Usually, a behavior like barking can take a few weeks.
