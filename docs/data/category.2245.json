In this article, we guide you about training your dog so you have the tools you need to teach your dog when and when not to bark.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark6-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9939\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark6-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark6-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark6-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark6.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Until you train your dog otherwise, they basically think they must report everything pretty much they hear, as they hear it. To your dog, anything can be a potential threat, and barking is their only alarm. Especially when you are living in an apartment, one of the main reasons your dog barks is random noises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To dogs who are sensitive to noise and vibrations, loud neighbors, other animals, kids, and random noises that come with the everyday life of apartment living probably sound a little bit like a purge until you see what is really going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 5 Basic Steps to Successful Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important not to discipline your dog every time they bark, but teach them when and how to instead. You can use these steps to train your dog for almost anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9940\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark3.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to have your dog bark trained is by teaching them how to bark properly. Once your dog realizes there is a time and a place for barking, they will start to bark less at seemingly everything. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The 5 Steps to Training Your Dog are:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Observe (The Reaction)</li><li>Introduce (The Sound)</li><li>Replace (Reaction with Command)</li><li>Reward &amp; Repeat</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Observe</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by observing what triggers your dog barking so you can plan what you need to work on. It&#8217;s likely your dog is triggered by the same noises every time so take note of what you need to train your dog on and work on those areas specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Introduce</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next is to introduce your dog to the sound so they can understand where it is coming from. Much of the time, dogs are barking out of curiosity, and you can help them stop barking at the same things in the future by teaching them what the sounds are. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9941\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark1.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your dog is triggered by noise in the hall, let your dog watch what is making the noise. If your dog barks at people in the hallway, it is helpful to try and let your dog meet as many of your neighbors as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likely your pet barks at your next-door neighbors the most since they&#8217;re the closest, and your dog can&#8217;t always tell if it&#8217;s their door or yours. So, if your neighbor and your dog are both friendly, try a meet and greet as they&#8217;re coming and going so your dog gets familiar with them and stops barking at them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Training Exercise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that your dog is familiar with the white noise and people of your building, start training them on the sound of your next-door neighbors if that&#8217;s a problem area for your dog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have your neighbor leave and come back and work on how your dog reacts. When your dog starts to react to the noise of your neighbor, start by getting your dog to sit and work up to add in your own &#8216;no barking command&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9942\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-leah-kelley-776373-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When your dog hears them and starts to react, get them to sit and stay. Open your door, so your dog can associate the sound with the person. Now that your dog knows that the sound of the keys in the lock next door is just your friendly neighbor who isn&#8217;t a threat, they will start barking less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat the exercise; this time, don&#8217;t open the door right away. Ask your dog to sit and use your no-barking command to get the dog to sit and try to be quiet before opening the door. Your dog probably knows who is on the other side of the door if you do this a few times in a row, so it is important to do this outside of your training exercise as well. As your dog starts to change his reactions, keep refreshing the training and rewarding their efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Barking at Your Door</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next situation you want to train your dog in is when there is a knock on your door. Since your dog thinks he is doing his job by reporting every noise to you, it is important to teach him which noises to look out for and how to react to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9946\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark7.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have observed how they are reacting and you have decided how you want them trained, it&#8217;s time to work on replacing their barking with that reaction instead. Training is most effective if you can dedicate time out each day for your dog where you are going to work on the specific things, rather than just trying to correct the behavior as it pops up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you want to do is get their attention by having them sit. Once they&#8217;re sitting, work on getting them to stop barking using your designated command. Reward them for sitting and for any efforts made to stop barking at your word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have them trained to stop barking on command try to repeat the situation a<a href=\"https://www.petsmart.ca/dog/treats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nd reward them for stopping a few times in a row</a>. Try to avoid calling your dog badly, focus on rewarding for changed behavior instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark5-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9948\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark5-1.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In time, your dog will learn to ignore the noises entirely. Once your dog is more used to everything and you start training, you can begin to train them on how they are barking at your company and at you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Knock Training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you want to train them on is knocks on the door. A big reason why dogs bark is they think you or someone else is at the door. So, you want to teach them how to tell the differences and how you want them to act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way of doing this is with knock training for when the company is at the door and for when you are coming home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When It&#8217;s Company</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a friend stand on the other side of the closed door with you and your dog inside. Have them knock on the door, and you train your dog on how you want them to react to someone knocking on the door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, you want to start with training them to sit and get them to stop barking using their newly taught word.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark8-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9947\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark8.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Observe</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your friend to knock, and you observe your dog&#8217;s reaction, try to resist intervening or saying a command, and wait out until they are done, if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Introduce</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduce your dog to what is making the sound. Show your dog that it is actually someone at your door that they are responding to. Don&#8217;t open the door but acknowledge that your dog is alerting you about someone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you want to get them to sit and if you can, stop barking using your word before you open the door. If they still are barking, continue training.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Replace</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you want to do is replace the reaction with what you are teaching them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat your friend knocking and your dog sitting with rewards a few times in a row. Once they are sitting for you, as a reaction, you can teach them a command to go with it that tells them to stop or not to bark when there is a knock at the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark9-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9945\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark9.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Have your friend knock again, and when your dog barks, have them sit and tell them the command. Encourage them to stop barking with that command and once your dog stops barking, say the command and praise them, so they associate the word with being quiet and being quiet with praise and reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Repeat &amp; Reward</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some dogs pick it up right away; others may need a few more training days or weeks. It is important to keep training consistent until your dog does get it before they start to go back to their old behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/7-fun-ways-to-celebrate-halloween-with-your-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dogs respond much better to praise and reward</a>.

If your dog feels like you are getting angry at them for barking, this may make your dog&#8217;s barking or other reactions worse and harder to train.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bark2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9944\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/bark2.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continue to praise them for the following days to a couple of weeks while they are still fresh with it. Remember, when it comes to changing behavior like barking with your dog, consistency, praise, and patience are key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your dog is only as smart as you make them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training your dog how to react when it is you helps them tell the difference between strangers and you when they are home alone. This will help your dog be more relaxed towards people in the hallway passing by and your neighbors coming and going while you are out as it teaches your dog to recognize when you are home and when it&#8217;s just someone passing by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that your dog is only as trained as you let them be. Every dog is different. There is no magic number of times or amount of time until your dog is totally trained in this way. Usually, a behavior like barking can take a few weeks.

Moving can be hard on everyone in your household, not just us, but our pets are much more affected by moving than we may be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animals do have a harder time with moving than us since they don&#8217;t get the luxury of being able to mentally prepare as we do for something as big as moving to a new home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Think Ahead</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to try and make a move as easy as possible for your feline friend, who can be particularly sensitive when it comes to moving. The best thing you can do is start by thinking ahead. Sometimes we don&#8217;t always get to plan everything, but moving with animals, when possible, the earlier you get yourself and your pets ready, the easier it will be on everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to try and keep our pets in mind a couple of weeks before the moving day if that&#8217;s possible in your situation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg\" alt=\"Cat inside a box\" class=\"wp-image-9901\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Packing up your house can be hard on your cat, so you want to get them used to the process early. Luckily, this can also be fun for your pet with your help. We all know that as soon as there&#8217;s an empty box, cats will be in it or trying to be. After all, the saying goes, &#8220;if I fit, I sit, right&#8221;? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let them have some fun by leaving a couple of empty boxes around where you are packing, so it gets them used to the action and it gives them something to play with. You get bonus points if you want to cut holes in the sides of the boxes to really provide them with something to have fun with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that you can do to get your cat ready for moving out is to have a dedicated kitty-corner set up for them a couple of weeks in advance, so they already have a safe space when moving day comes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat sleeping in a box\" class=\"wp-image-9902\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing to remember is that the transition can only go as smoothly as you help make it. With a bit of preparation and thinking ahead, you can help make this transition as smooth as possible for your cat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting The Old Place Ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If it is possible, it&#8217;s best to have an area or a room set up for your cat that is comfortable and will be packed last. Set this area up with stuff for your cat to help make moving easier on them.

You want to make sure that they will feel comfortable in their new home. If you can, it&#8217;s best to set up a safe area at the new place, too, and take your cat over there to explore the empty house first. This makes it a little less stressful having to spend some time in there while you do the heavy lifting and unpacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would preferably be a room or section of the house or apartment that you can move your cat into with its comfort items and will be set up for its actual use last. Keep your kitty comfy in this area while you set up the house. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let them Explore</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are ready to let your cat explore their newly set up environment, make sure you hold off on taking apart the moving room and try to keep their safe space available for the first little while until they are more comfortable in the new place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat exploring a new room\" class=\"wp-image-9905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1.jpg 1094w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Things to include in the room:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You pretty much want to include whatever you had set up at the old place or to include the same kind of items that you have set up at the old place.

You gotta love ‘em! Whether they’re fuzzy, feathery, or scaly, having animals makes a home happier. Mine recently became a three-cat household, and there’s always enough drama, excitement, and heartwarming cuteness to make every day an adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re thinking of adding a few paws, claws, or fins to your family, I urge you to consider making your adoption from one of the many local shelters and rescues. Providing a “furever” home for an animal in need will give you warm fuzzies inside <em>and </em>out &#8211; because pets are snuggly, <em>and</em> you’re supplying a loving environment to a creature who wouldn’t have one otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Before you adopt</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot to consider when choosing a pet. Before you get sucked in by all the adorable faces at your local rescue, assess your lifestyle and needs so you can find the “purrfect” pet for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to think about stuff like:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Space</strong> &#8211; your living space, specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do you rent or own?</strong> Check your leasing agreement to ensure a pet is allowed!</li><li><strong>Do you have room for activities?</strong> If you have a 500 square foot bachelor suite, a Great Dane probably isn’t for you.</li><li><strong>What about floor space?</strong> They’ll need a bed, bathroom, food, and toys. You’re making room for them in your life emotionally <em>and </em>physically.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finances</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Have you budgeted for ongoing costs?</strong> Your new pet needs food, litter, toys, treats, and regular vaccinations and check-ups even after the initial adoption fees. Make sure you’re OK to set aside some of your monthly scratches to take care of your pet.</li><li><strong>What about emergencies?</strong> If Fido swallows a priceless action figure or scarfs down the pan of brownies you left on the counter, you will need to make an emergency trip to the vet! These forays are usually <em>expensive</em>. Whether you stash away a chunk of that monthly pet budget into an emergency fund or have a spare credit card ready to go, make sure to have a plan in place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-1024x740.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7148\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-300x217.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-770x557.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-293x212.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498-500x362.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-camila-a-9136498.jpg 1195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How often are you at home? </strong>Whether you’re home all day or gone in 10-hour stretches is a major factor in what kind of pet you should get. Training a new puppy requires constant vigilance, whereas a mature animal is better suited to spend time alone.</li><li><strong>How much time are you prepared to spend with them? </strong>All pets need quality time with their owners to establish and maintain a bond, just like any relationship. However, some animals are more independent, and others will hound you for attention. Assess how much time you can allocate to walking, grooming, feeding, playing, training, and petting, and adjust accordingly.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Energy level</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How active are you?</strong> Getting up to walk the dog in the morning is a good motivator, but it might also be something you regret committing to. Or, if you want a buddy to go with you on runs, somebody who wants to lie by the fire all day is not for you.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All animals require an investment of time and energy. What varies is how much. Even the most independent of animals need attention and care. So before you scurry off to the pound, take a moment’s “paws” to deliberate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adopt On!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re looking for a dog, cat, rabbit, guinea pig, or something more exotic, there are many local shelters you could choose to adopt from, such as D’Arcy’s Arc, Winnipeg Pet Rescue, Craig Street Cats, or the Winnipeg Humane Society.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7149\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-helena-lopes-1378849.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Multiple visits <em>are</em> necessary</strong>. Chant this mantra to protect yourself against the impending cuteness. It’s hard not to come home with <em>all </em>the animals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shop around</strong> &#8211; don’t settle on the first pair of adorable eyes you see. When you do find an animal you connect with, you will know. When you find an animal you love, it’s ruff not to take them home immediately. But, a pet shouldn’t be an impulse decision. Many shelters will allow you to put a hold or deposit on the animal you’d like to adopt. Do this and sleep on the decision. If you still feel the same way in the morning, it might be time to take that chance. If you find yourself second-guessing, you may want to re-assess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Age and personality </strong>are much more relevant than an animal’s breed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider adopting an adult animal if you can. A new puppy or kitten is tempting, but they are a <em>lot </em>more work. Mature animals are more likely to be overlooked at shelters, but they’re often much more aware and grateful when they do get taken home. Plus, if they’re already potty trained, that’s a huge bonus!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get to know them by spending time with them at the shelter and talking with the staff who work with them daily to get a feel for the animal’s personality. Are they adventurous and playful? Social or stand-offish? How do they react to new people or interact with other animals? One isn’t necessarily better than the other, but think about what traits suit you best.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"7150\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369.jpg\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=7150\" class=\"wp-image-7150\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve decided on your new friend, bully for you! Be sure to get a full rundown of the <strong>health and history of the animal </strong>before signing the paperwork. Find out what shots they’ve had or still need, and if they’re already spayed or neutered, or if that’s something you need to arrange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you welcome them home, prepare a dedicated space in a separate room of your place so they can be introduced to the rest of the residents slowly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Homeward Bound!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>safe place </strong>is the first thing they need. New environments are scary for anyone! Of course, you’re eager to snuggle and play with your new roommate, but it’s important to remember it can take some time for your pet to adjust to its new home. Some agencies will even send along a blanket or something with a familiar scent that you can add to their setup for a bit of extra comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Establishing a routine</strong> is the best thing you can do to settle them in. The more they know what to expect on a day-to-day basis, the more comfortable they’ll be. Try to do things like feeding around the exact times every day. Keep going through the motions of a typical day, and eventually, they’ll begin to fall into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7151\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/11/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4498185-1.jpg 1555w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spending quality time with them</strong> during this initial settling-in stage is incredibly important. You’re trying to establish a new friend! Make sure to spend time talking to them, playing with them, and even just hanging out with them. If they’re shy or nervous, sitting quietly in the same space and doing something relaxed like reading a book or watching tv can help them get used to you being around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Treats </strong>are a great tool for enforcing good behaviors and easing separation anxiety. A treat when your pup lets you know he needs to pee or when the kitty tries out the designated scratching post will push their behavior in the right direction. And they’re not so worried when you leave if they get snacks when you do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have patience!</strong> Some animals will take to everything right away, while some may take a few days. My venerable Tiamat hates moving (who doesn’t!?) and will slink around warily for days until she knows every corner has been properly vetted. When we brought our newest one home, he was out galloping around with his new friend within the hour. Some animals may take weeks or even months to adjust fully, so be patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re “fur-tunate” enough to welcome an animal into your family, you will have made a “pawsitive” difference in both of your lives. You will always be the person who changed their lives for the better. And it’s such a joy to see them run to welcome you home, playing happily or sleeping comfortably in the sun. By choosing to rescue an animal, you free up space for the shelter to help more animals, <em>and</em> you give that animal a loving home. So hop to it and flock to your nearest rescue or shelter.
