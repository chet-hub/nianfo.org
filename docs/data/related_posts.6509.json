The rest of my apartment&nbsp;was light on&nbsp;décor and&nbsp;heavy on&nbsp;notebooks and papers. However,&nbsp;a&nbsp;year of dreaming&nbsp;about decorating&nbsp;as soon as my bank account would&nbsp;allow,&nbsp;made me focus on&nbsp;identifying the&nbsp;colours, shapes and styles&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wanted around&nbsp;me. That research, inspiration boards and constant visits to vintage shops&nbsp;helped me form a clear picture&nbsp;of what pieces I needed. I focused on mid-century inspired furniture, minimal artwork, and a&nbsp;palette of grey, blue and yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;surrounded by millions of choices. Online shopping&nbsp;means we can order&nbsp;a coffee table with two clicks.&nbsp;Or we can drive to the nearest big-box store and pick out a couch on the spot. But even with&nbsp;a plethora of choices,&nbsp;it can be hard to find just the right item to make your space feel complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mistake of not&nbsp;doing your research&nbsp;means you’re not&nbsp;defining&nbsp;your&nbsp;style and&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;colour palette. Without a precise idea&nbsp;of what you’re looking for,&nbsp;shopping trips&nbsp;quickly spiral into&nbsp;confusion and irritation.&nbsp;On the other hand, a clear picture of what you want&nbsp;will make&nbsp;every&nbsp;store visit&nbsp;easier—even if it takes you a while to find what you’re looking for.&nbsp;Instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;making&nbsp;impulsive purchases as soon as you move in,&nbsp;focus on studying the space, picking&nbsp;your&nbsp;favourite colours, planning the amount of furniture, and imagining&nbsp;the final look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6522\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-300x264.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-770x678.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1536x1353.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-293x258.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1400x1233.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-500x441.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research.jpg 1832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick research tips</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use Pinterest to create virtual inspiration boards and save your ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Browse&nbsp;interior design magazines like Vogue Living, ELLE Decoration, House &amp; Garden,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Style at Home&nbsp;(check the library for free copies, but no cutting out photos!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Take your inspiration from cinematography!&nbsp;Pick the era or style you want to reflect in your place and gather ideas from movies&nbsp;set in&nbsp;that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A&nbsp;stroll&nbsp;through the park, evening at the lake,&nbsp;or walk in the snow&nbsp;can not only&nbsp;give you&nbsp;ideas,&nbsp;but&nbsp;also be a great photography inspiration for DIY décor!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 2:&nbsp;Buying everything at once&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband is a wise man: he held&nbsp;my hand&nbsp;to keep it away from my&nbsp;credit card every time I was close to&nbsp;making an&nbsp;impulsive&nbsp;purchase. He&nbsp;would ask, “Would this item&nbsp;bring&nbsp;you&nbsp;the same joy&nbsp;a few years from now?”&nbsp;When I did eventually make purchases,&nbsp;I found myself fully satisfied with&nbsp;my choices.&nbsp;Plus,&nbsp;I really enjoyed&nbsp;looking around&nbsp;and&nbsp;taking&nbsp;the time to explore&nbsp;unknown&nbsp;shops&nbsp;to finally find that one unique item.&nbsp;(I’m&nbsp;also&nbsp;happy with my&nbsp;husband for&nbsp;talking me out of buying things spontaneously&nbsp;without&nbsp;a second thought!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-buy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6521\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furniture, especially essential pieces we use every day, is not&nbsp;something we can&nbsp;easily&nbsp;donate&nbsp;whenever you want to try something new. A dining table is not a sweater that&nbsp;can&nbsp;be worn twice and then passed&nbsp;on&nbsp;to someone else.&nbsp;The furniture we bring into our homes is usually with us a long time, so we should&nbsp;surround ourselves with&nbsp;things&nbsp;we genuinely enjoy looking at and using day after day.&nbsp;The consumer mentality is also changing. Minimalism and mindful purchasing&nbsp;are&nbsp;more than just trendy; they’re&nbsp;a helpful way to create less clutter and&nbsp;do less harm to the&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve done the hard work of defining your design concept and choosing colours,&nbsp;the&nbsp;next&nbsp;mistake to avoid would be buying it all at once. There is no worse feeling than the regret of the&nbsp;poor&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;you no longer like after just a few months.&nbsp;You walk around that no-longer-beautiful&nbsp;coffee table, blaming yourself&nbsp;for not searching longer because&nbsp;just yesterday&nbsp;you saw&nbsp;the coffee table of your dreams—too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hunt is the most exciting part of interior design!&nbsp;Sorting through&nbsp;local flea markets,&nbsp;exploring furniture stores&nbsp;other than The&nbsp;Brick and Ikea, looking for artisan-made pieces,&nbsp;not stopping until you’ve found the perfect piece… It’s fun and satisfying and will pay off for years to come!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 3: </strong><strong>Choosing</strong><strong>&nbsp;only trendy pieces</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trends surround us for&nbsp;specific reasons. Companies follow fashion trends to sell more. People follow them to stay&nbsp;fashionable&nbsp;and&nbsp;project a certain image.&nbsp;Not every trend&nbsp;is&nbsp;worth following, though. Many trends won’t reflect&nbsp;your&nbsp;personal taste, and&nbsp;some trends don’t last very long.&nbsp;The same way leather leggings&nbsp;won’t always be popular,&nbsp;distinctly uncomfortable furniture trends will fade after a few seasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember&nbsp;the year of the&nbsp;ubiquitous obsession with golden pineapples.&nbsp;Pineapples were everywhere:&nbsp;on pillows, candles, cups, and even on bigger pieces of furniture.&nbsp;Pineapples were all over&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;on every shelf and every t-shirt. However, the trend faded rapidly&nbsp;because&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;real meaning behind it. (Don’t&nbsp;get me wrong: pineapple is delicious!). The&nbsp;poor&nbsp;pineapple&nbsp;is a great example of&nbsp;those trends that&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;becomes monotonous and gets thrown away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"974\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6520\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg 974w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-285x300.jpg 285w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-770x810.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1460x1536.jpg 1460w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-293x308.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1400x1473.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-500x526.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple.jpg 1755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, you’ll find a lot more&nbsp;pleasure in simple lines, quality materials, and classic designs. Trends&nbsp;can be fun to play with when adjusted for your&nbsp;personal style,&nbsp;but they’re better suited to&nbsp;small pieces such as&nbsp;pictures, candles, cups,&nbsp;and pillows. Those pieces are&nbsp;easier&nbsp;to replace when you’re&nbsp;tired of the trend or want to refresh it for another season. When searching&nbsp;for&nbsp;basic, important&nbsp;pieces of furniture, stay closer to minimal design and timeless forms&nbsp;to avoid long-term regret.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake 4: Picking&nbsp;the cheapest pieces&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, a&nbsp;carefully thought-out&nbsp;budget&nbsp;will save you&nbsp;money and allow you to purchase higher-quality pieces. Cheap, mass-produced&nbsp;furniture&nbsp;is like&nbsp;fast-fashion clothing.&nbsp;Cheap garments,&nbsp;and&nbsp;cheap furniture, are not made&nbsp;to last long. Brands&nbsp;hope for your return after the chair&nbsp;breaks in a year or two or&nbsp;the&nbsp;jeans rip after six months.&nbsp;They&nbsp;give up&nbsp;quality&nbsp;in favour of the&nbsp;cheapest-possible materials&nbsp;in mass production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until&nbsp;consumer habits change, cheap furniture and poor-quality clothing will&nbsp;stick around. As soon as we, as consumers, understand that higher-quality wood and fabric require more money, and better-made pieces require more time and effort,&nbsp;we can see the value in buying quality.&nbsp;Quality furniture,&nbsp;made to last,&nbsp;might&nbsp;seem more expensive than mass-produced housewares. But&nbsp;by&nbsp;buying a better-quality piece, you’re&nbsp;investing&nbsp;in the number of years&nbsp;the item will last without needing repair or replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6519\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your&nbsp;couch wears out after a year of sitting on it, you&nbsp;might buy another&nbsp;low-quality one.

Also, consider handmade and vintage furniture!
