So we made a quick pitstop to check out 300 Main on our way into the Exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located with bike lanes immediately behind the building and a bi-directional bike lane a block away, it’s easy peasy to get anywhere by bike from 300 Main.&nbsp; It was simple to stop for a quick visit to show my pals, and from there, we used the handy bike lane on Fort Street to connect us to the Exchange and on to our adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10480\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB12.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to our first Nuit Blanche stop, we took the Fort Street bike lane, which becomes a protected bike lane once you cross Portage Avenue.&nbsp; We took this to Adelaide Street, where we popped over to Arts Junktion.&nbsp; They were running a bike decorating spot, where you could also get your bike looked over by The Wrench.&nbsp; Now that our bikes and helmets were all decorated, we were ready for the rest of the night!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10481\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB11.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes to the Little Brown Jug Brewery Street party and were greeted with great tunes from DJs set up on their newly upgraded patio, food trucks along the closed street, and plenty of amazing beer.&nbsp; We went inside the brewery to check out their art installation, Moths to a Flame, by Warner Carther.&nbsp; Incorporating transparent glass and light projections, the entire space was lit up with flickering flames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to end the night back in the Exchange, which really is the main centre of Nuit Blanche, so from Little Brown Jug, we cycled up Adelaide Street to the McDermot Avenue bi-directional bike lane, then across Main Street to Stephen Juba Park, along Waterfront Drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10482\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-1024x801.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-300x235.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-770x603.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14-293x229.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB14.png 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two really great installations along the bike and walking path through Stephen Juba Park.&nbsp; The first we saw was Kasuri, located near the Mere Hotel and created by Takashhi Iwasaki &amp; Joe Kalturnyk.&nbsp; This was a fun, interactive light exhibit, where viewers could turn wheels at the side, which made central pieces move and float, like shimmering blue and pink helix.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10483\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB13.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next stop was Elucida, created by Biom Lab.&nbsp; Elucida resembled beautiful, colourful patio lanterns strung between the large trees in the park.&nbsp; This effect was emphasized by a group that had set up patio chairs and were hanging out, occasionally chatting with passers by that they knew from the mass of people walking through.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10484\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB10.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We walked our bikes out from the thick of people and managed to get a nice little ride along the fenced bike path that leads under the Esplanade Riel Bridge.&nbsp; We stopped at the foot of the bridge, behind the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, to take in Ikuma by Geronimo Inutiq, presented by the Winnipeg Art Gallery.&nbsp; Ikuma from Inuktitut translates to flame, fire, or spark, and this audiovisual program was fascinating to watch and listen to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10485\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB9.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many different installations and events taking place at The Forks for Nuit Blanche, and we checked out three of them.&nbsp; Homesick Angels by Joshua Banman, located at the CN Stage, was an interactive exhibit where the audience was projected onto a bank of vintage television sets, becoming angels with coloured halos, laser eyes, and flames in their hands.&nbsp; It was mesmerizing to watch and play with, as well as a little eerie and creepy due to the classical music playing softly at the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10486\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB8.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also saw Renaissance of Memory by Nayden, set up on the 5th floor of the parkade.&nbsp; With digital projections as well as little vignettes of tables, toys, and televisions dotted throughout the space, this was a fun piece to wander around and explore while contemplating memory, nostalgia, and sentimental longing for childhood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10487\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB7-63347ad3c2c37.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our final stop at the Forks was to see Bikes, Lights, Nights by Sputnik Architecture with bikes from the Plain Bicycle Project.&nbsp; The project created an upside-down world of suspended, multicolour, lit-up bicycles high in the tree canopy of the Forks Patio (to the left of the harbour, as you face the river).&nbsp; It was truly magical to see!&nbsp; This installation will run until the end of Culture Days, on October 16, so there is still some time to catch it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From The Forks, we zipped along the bike path that leads to Assiniboine Avenue, taking the bi-directional protected bike lane on Garry Street back to the Exchange District.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10488\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB6.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To say the Exchange was packed would truly be an understatement!&nbsp; We explored two exhibits along McDermot. Panotptibot II, by Toxic, captured live images from audience participants, projecting them into the walls of a party in the building behind. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-1024x658.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10489\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-1024x658.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-300x193.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-770x495.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5-293x188.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/09/NB5.png 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up the street from Panoptibot II,&nbsp; we visited Pop of Art at Tara Davis Studio Boutique, which featured whimsical window installations by Kami Goertz and Darci Madlung that glowed delightfully in black light.

The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks is already a beloved Winnipeg Spot, a hot spot for activities, shows, tours, and history. With many new exciting additions, even if you&#8217;re already local to The Forks, you&#8217;ll want to plan a trip there for sure. With new one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants, and even a new arcade, this old favourite feels like a new one! Relax outside or get some work done with a local craft beer from one of the great indoor or outdoor bars and lounge areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Get To Know Downtown Winnipeg&#8217;s Art, Culture, and History with a Tour!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is famous for its beautiful historic murals, sculptures, and various other forms of art throughout its streets.

The Trolly has been a tourist staple of downtown Winnipeg for many years already. With in-depth city tours and bookable ghost tours, they are definitely worth the ride! Prefer an indoor tour? Many of Downtown&#8217;s museums offer free or affordable admission. The WAG does free exhibits and days (selected dates), as well as a discounted rate on the first Wednesday of the month for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. But there are many other museums Downtown you can check out that offer cheap or free admission, such as the Winnipeg Police Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Events</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is full of exciting activities all season long! Enjoy things like yoga and fitness in the park, movies, concerts, and more!

Enjoy classes taught by top downtown instructors from top Winnipeg gyms and yoga studios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Take a Downtown Patio Crawl</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy a stroll downtown and some of Winnipeg&#8217;s best food and patios on a Downtown patio crawl. One of the best things about being in Downtown Winnipeg is everything is relatively close to each other, including Winnipeg&#8217;s best patio spots!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t be doing a downtown patio crawl without stopping in at Winnipeg&#8217;s already favorite spot, The Forks! With two new bars, one indoor and one outdoor, an extended licensed patio seating area, and not to mention tons of delicious restaurants to pick up some fantastic food at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Roca</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closely connecting the next few stops on Smith Street is La Roca. They are known for their impressive selection of tequila, delicious Mexican cuisine, and good patio right in the heart of downtown Winnipeg!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tavern United Roof-Top</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Downtown Tavern United (<em>aka roof-top-tav</em>) has a nice rooftop patio and bar that gives you an exciting view of Downtown!

There’s nothing more relaxing and rejuvenating than enjoying nature. One of my favourite places in downtown during fall is along the Assiniboine River—I love the crisp air and the carpet of leaves crunching beneath my feet as I stroll the path. It’s always confounded me that the sound of dead leaves can make the air crackle with life.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></p>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Denise Runions (@msdeerun)</a> on Oct 22, 2016 at 11:02am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My route usually starts at the Forks, where I grab a steaming cup of joe from <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>. Warming beverage in hand, I make my way west, ending up outside the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a>. Even when other people are using the path, the river walkway is a serene place to spend autumn days.</p>\n<h3>Hot Drinks to Warm You Up (&amp; Where to Find Them)</h3>\n<p>The fragrant aromas of apple cider and hot cocoa are the ultimate reminder that fall is in the air! Downtown Winnipeg is the hub for the top-of-the-line coffee shops, and the place to be to satisfy your pumpkin-spiced cravings. Coffee shops such as <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/home-blend\">Thom Bargen</a> or <a href=\"https://secondcup.com/location/254-edmonton-street\">Second Cup Coffee Co.</a> are some of my top-picks for their seasonal drink menus. Here are some of my favourite seasonal drinks, guaranteed to have you feeling warm and toasty from the inside out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\"><strong>Fools and Horses</strong></a><br />\nFools and Horses is not afraid to get a little creative with hot fall drinks; they offer pumpkin spice lattes, but their Boreal Latte truly shines! This delicious beverage is created with one-of-a-kind ingredients including pine syrup, sage, sweetgrass, elderflower, and juniper. Trust me: it’s something special.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></p>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by grace demers (@gracedmrs)</a> on Sep 22, 2019 at 6:52pm PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/home-blend\"><strong>Thom Bargen</strong></a><br />\nThe pumpkin spiced latte is the spokesperson for fall drinks, and in my opinion, no one does pumpkin drinks better than Thom Bargen!

There are a lot of options, and I find myself wondering where I should go on the longest night of art exhibitions in the city. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about that for very long this year because friends of mine already had plans in place to start off the night.</p>\n<h3>Slam! All-Star Poets Compete For Your Scores!</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/\">Thom Bargen Coffee and Tea</a></strong></p>\n<p>Having been a member of the spoken word community for a long time, I was pleased to be asked to perform at Winnipeg Poetry Slam’s Nuit Blanche event. I was also part of the Winnipeg Poetry Slam team for 2018, which later competed in the National Poetry Slam in Guelph, part of the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word.</p>\n<p>For Nuit Blanche, seven of us poets got together, and we gave art lovers a show to start off the night! It was a great opportunity for me because I was able to introduce new friends of mine to the spoken word community; they&#8217;d never been to a poetry slam before and had no idea what to expect. I find that these are often the best minds to have at a poetry slam, as they&#8217;re the most receptive and will get the most out of the poetry itself. With a small group of artists, poets, and other art enthusiasts in tow, I started us off on our journey through Nuit Blanche. Here are a few of the installations we saw as we ventured forth into the night.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fvideos%2F171998770396697%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/our-communities/metro/Whimsical-art-piece-a-first-for-Wolseley-artist-493489791.html\">&#8220;Hand of the Machine&#8221; by Solmund MacPherson</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/branchpages/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library</a> Courtyard</strong></p>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Nuit Blanche Winnipeg. Situated next to another installation (“<a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/emptyful\">emptyful</a>”) in the courtyard behind the Millennium Library was our first installation of the night: a massive and well-lit hand stretching out into the night air, with control levers that moved the fingers. In some cases, interactive art installations are built to last. But by the time we arrived, about an hour and a half into Nuit Blanche, the middle finger was broken and hanging limp in the middle of the palm. While we were there, I also saw the installation fall forward more than once, like a wrestler trying to tap out. Instead, someone picked it up and put it back into the fight. Before leaving we grabbed a few free books from the assortment the library had set up, and I played a game of oversized Connect 4.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve never herd of bison&#8221; by Kale Bonham and Todd Scott</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/\"><strong>Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park</strong></a></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fphotos%2Fa.1673473746070347%2F2146671585417225%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"535\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t think I appreciated this installation enough. It was a group of sound-activated bison next to the illumination board that lines the back side of Upper Fort Garry Park. When we got there, there wasn&#8217;t much noise to trigger the bison to react, so we moved on quickly. However, I&#8217;ve since seen images of the installation reacting to crowds of people, and it looks quite interesting!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://woodanchor.com/img_0496/\">&#8220;Run For Your Lite&#8221; by Wood Anchor and Cloverdale Forge</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/things-to-do/attractions/display,listing/05735/esplanade-riel-pedestrian-bridge\">Esplanade Riel bridge</a> landing</strong></p>\n<p>After a stop in <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/attractions/the-forks-market\">The Forks Market</a> to grab a bite to eat and a coffee, we moved on to the next few installations, but none caught my eye like this one. You could see the installation for what it was: Free energy. It took the form of a large wooden &#8220;hamster wheel&#8221; with a handle bar to grip, covered with lights and connected to turbines that would not only illuminate the installation but also power a nearby forge. The crowd was as loud as the machine itself, shouting support to friends who decided to try their hand at powering the forge!</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1895361463881573%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"622\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>We sat and watched people compete to see who could keep running the longest, all the while drawing cheers of support from onlookers. It seemed like 5 to 8 minutes was the best folks could handle before the momentum started making them slip or lose their balance. It was definitely entertaining to watch as we ate the food we bought (seating inside was impossible to find) before walking up to Waterfront to move on to the Exchange District.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://connectingcities.net/project/control-no-control\">&#8220;Control No Control&#8221; by Daniel Iregui</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/shipping-container-exhibit/\">&#8220;Container Architecture&#8221; by Winnipeg Architecture Foundation</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Bijou Park, East of Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/57144334\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Setup alongside Old Market Square, Bijou Park (which hosts Kids Fringe activities during the summer festival) hosted two displays during this year&#8217;s Nuit Blanche. On one side of the park, &#8220;Control No Control&#8221; featured a massive LED panel that reacted to both touch and sound input from the ever-growing crowd around it. On the other side of the park, nestled up to the side of Smoke&#8217;s Poutinerie, the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation set up a converted shipping container. It featured various other architectural projects around the world, showcasing the use of shipping containers as raw materials to build sustainable structures and housing. As a big supporter of sustainable living initiatives, this struck home with me.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/impulse\">&#8220;Impulse&#8221; presented by The Winnipeg Arts Council</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRG4PMlY38Y\" width=\"324\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One of the biggest installations I’ve seen, &#8220;Impulse&#8221; was a collection of massive light-beam seesaws for riders of all ages. No matter how many videos or pictures I tried to take of this spectacle, none could do it justice. Every face in Old Market Square that night was filled with excitement and exhilaration!</p>\n<p>There were many other ways for everyone to enjoy Nuit Blanche last year, including community events, gallery shows, and live exhibitions throughout the night.

Manitoba summers bring beautiful weather, and there is no shortage of things to do outside while soaking up the sun and staying active. With scenic architecture, beautiful trails, green parks, and tons of events, downtown is full things to see while you stay active this summer.</p>\n<h3>Follow the Riverwalk</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about downtown is the <a href=\"https://www.travelmanitoba.com/listings/the-forks-historic-port-and-riverwalk/6764/\">riverwalk</a>. Winnipeg is famous for the <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/river-trail\">skating trail</a> in the winter, which is among the longest in Canada, but you don’t need to wait for the ice to freeze to enjoy the sights. The river trail is a beautiful, accessible path that winds alongside our river. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the path as it stretches through <a href=\"https://www.osbornevillage.com/\">Osborne Village</a> and surrounds The Forks. It’s a gorgeous choice for a weekend stroll, and practical enough for your daily commute!</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9Mei2jg8C/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Sit back and relax with <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/movies-on-memorial/\">Movies on Memorial</a> this summer at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Memorial+provincial+park/@49.8832967,-97.1610086,14z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smemorial+park!3m4!1s0x0:0x6c1f4758bc336034!8m2!3d49.8866164!4d-97.1485806\">Memorial Park</a>.

Sit down dining not really your thing? Check out downtown <a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/eat-and-drink/peg-city-grub/read,post/881/2019-winnipeg-food-truck-guide\">Winnipeg’s many food trucks</a> this summer! With a surprising amount of variety and high-quality dishes, it’ll make you rethink street food. Don’t forget to check back at the end of summer for the <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/events/food-truck-wars/\">Manyfest</a> (Food Truck Wars). This year’s competition runs from September 6 to 8, which is arguably the end of the food truck season for Winnipeg.</p>\n<h3>Soak up the Arts in the Exchange District</h3>\n<p><strong>Reggae Fest</strong><br />\nIn July, Winnipeg hosts the Winnipeg <a href=\"https://srfwpg.blogspot.com/\">Soca Reggae Festival</a>. This is one for your summer to-do list for sure! Catch the festival downtown at Winnipeg favourite, <a href=\"https://exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/\">The Cube Stage</a>. Reggae Fest is just one of many unique festivals that happens in the Exchange District every summer.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fringe Festival</strong><br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfringe.com/\">Fringe Festival</a> takes over the Exchange District every summer.

Between the throbbing nightclubs and laid-back bars, you’re bound to have a great time anywhere you go. In a city so full of live music and things to do, it can be hard to choose where to go⁠—but The Good Will Social Club and Forth Café are two of my favourites.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://thegoodwill.ca/\">The Good Will Social Club</a></h3>\n<p>The Good Will is located at 625 Portage Avenue, near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. At first glance, it looks like an okay option to stop for a beer, and you’d be right⁠—but it’s so much more than that! The Good Will often features DJs, bands, and karaoke. Once upon a time, I took part in a spelling “beer” there! Check out their online calendar to see what they’ve got going on.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">Forth Café</a></h3>\n<p>During the day this charming café at 171 McDermot Avenue is a great place for coffee and cocktails. However, this café has a not-so-secret secret: an intimate bar downstairs and a roof-top patio with views of the Exchange. The café closes at 10:00 pm during the week, but the bar and roof-top patio are <a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">open late</a>.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwR7W2UAyqU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

There’s something special about half of your city piling onto the streets, decked out in white and the hometown team’s apparel.</p>\n<p>Starting this year, there’s a cover fee of $5.00, but the fun you will have is priceless. All proceeds are going to <a href=\"https://unitedwaywinnipeg.ca/\">The United Way</a>, which will scatter the funds to several organizations in the city helping individuals with mental health and addiction services.</p>\n<p>But that seems to be the only thing that’s changing—seasoned whiteout goers can expect to see the same parties, with huge screens playing the game, local food trucks, beverages (both adult and youth-friendly), snacks, and activities. If you have tots in tow, the alcohol-free family zone at the <a href=\"http://winnipeglibraryfoundation.ca/tour-the-park/\">Millennium Library Park</a> has room for up to 4,000 people!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4185\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Cup, Winnipeg White Out Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Events, Go Jets Go, Winnipeg Jets, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Ice Hockey, Sports, Game Day, #WPGWhiteOut\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Prepare for a Whiteout</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties start exactly 2 hours before each game and the streets get packed fast, so make sure to get there on time if you want to get the full whiteout experience. <a href=\"https://www1.ticketmaster.ca/winnipeg-jets-whiteout-street-party-home-game-2/event/11005682CCE54415\">Buying a ticket</a> doesn’t guarantee you a spot on the street. The street party is capped at 15,000 people for safety reasons (unless you have a ticket to the game).</p>\n<p>From personal experience, I recommend coordinating beforehand if you’re meeting a group of friends. Cell reception can be a bit dodgy and slow with the giant mass amount of people around you, and texting them “I’m by the screen, I’m the one wearing white!” doesn’t exactly work in this situation.</p>\n<p>Don’t have a white Winnipeg Jets jersey? Don’t fret! Every white get-up is welcome, even a basic white tee-shirt. If you’re feeling extra festive, get creative! Grab a white wig, a white tutu, or whatever—there’s no better time to bust out that funky white hat stored in your Halloween costume box.</p>\n<h3>Pack the Essentials</h3>\n<p>Water bottle and a snack: You’re going to spend hours watching the game, chatting with your friends, and just enjoying the hustle and bustle of the party. Stay hydrated and energized by keeping a small snack and a water bottle with you. This also will save you a few bucks!</p>\n<p>Battery Pack: You’re going to want to capture every Instagram-worthy moment, and that is going to drain your phone fast!</p>\n<p>Jacket: As we get further into spring, we Winnipeggers tend to get a bit overconfident about what will be warm enough for us to wear. It may not be that cold at 5 pm when the parties start, but towards the end of the night, you’ll want something to wrap around you. Pack a lightweight jacket (white, obviously) just in case!</p>\n<h3>Get Around Downtown</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties are great for those of us going, but if you can’t make the excitement, navigating around downtown can be torturous! Here are the roads that will be closed during whiteout parties:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economicdevelopmentwinnipeg.com/winnipeg-whiteout/maps-and-resources?camefrom=EMCL_2841648_134922198\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4181 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Whiteout Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Jets, Go Jets Go, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Game Day, Sports, Downtown Living\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-232x300.jpg 232w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-770x996.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-500x647.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-293x379.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-1400x1812.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1.jpg 1700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" /></a></p>\n<p>• Donald between Portage and St. Mary<br />\n• Graham between Hargrave and Smith<br />\n• Smith between Portage and St. Mary</p>\n<p>These streets will be closed from 11:30 a.m. Friday through 6:30 a.m. Saturday for today’s party.</p>\n<h3>Personal Experience</h3>\n<p>My first whiteout was last spring, and as soon as I jumped off the bus onto Graham street, it was if I walked into a different dimension! For as far as my eyes could see, everyone was decked out in white. My nose quickly caught a whiff of the food trucks surrounding me, and my ears were bulldozed with the laughter and chatter of the crowd around me. I followed a mass of people to the center of the street, where hundreds upon hundreds of people were already gathered, getting ready for the game to light up the massive screen in front of us.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be a die-hard fan for the excitement to exist in you. Before experiencing my first whiteout, I enjoyed the occasional hockey game. But as soon as the screen switched on and the first puck hit the ice, I was roaring in unison with the crowd around me. We were loud and proud, screaming the second the Jets hit the ice, singing along to the Canadian anthem, and we kept up that enthusiasm until seconds before the Jets sunk their winning goal at the end of the game. It was like the entire crowd—no, the entire city—was holding its breath. Silence overcame the streets as our eyes were glued to the screen, waiting for the puck to hit net. As soon as it did, we were like a shaken soda bottle—the street exploded in deafening cheers! There must be cracks in the foundations of the buildings around us thanks to the deafening noise the Winnipeggers on the streets were making. I am honestly surprised we didn’t get a noise complaint from our neighboring city. I hugged everyone around me, people I had never seen before—but they felt like long-lost friends.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwGJe-dA0AP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He would be on time for his career counselling session at <a href=\"https://manitobastart.com/\">Manitoba Start</a>, just a few blocks away. This was his first session, and he breathed an inward sigh of relief that such a great resource was so close to his apartment building. He had just arrived last week and was eager to get settled. Securing a <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/mbcard.html\">Manitoba Health Card</a> and finding a family doctor had been fairly easy. He had even been able to use the free services of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit</a> bus since everything was within a few blocks of his new apartment in downtown.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-04-17T15:34:01+00:00\">Apr 17, 2018 at 8:34am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>As he walked to his destination, Henry cast a cursory glance around him. He was amazed at the diversity; people of all ethnicities and ages walked past him, in harmony with each other yet comfortably oblivious to their own surroundings. He noticed people rushing to work, too rushed to drink their coffee yet taking the time to hold open doors for others. He was falling in love with his new home! He felt a sense of belonging and was already looking forward to the weekend. He had seen posters for <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/\">ManyFest</a> and was excited to be living a short walk from where all the action would be. As he rushed across the cross walk, he thought about his plans for the coming weekend: the festival, a visit to the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/\">public library</a> to check out their collection and perhaps some Indian cuisine at a nearby restaurant. He realized he was talking to himself as he entered the the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/downtown_winnipeg_indoor_walkway_map_2013.pdf\">Downtown Winnipeg Indoor Walkway (lovingly known as the skywalk by locals)</a> to escape the gust of wind that threatened to sweep away the documents that he had been carrying. He shook his head, smiling. He couldn’t wait to get back to his apartment to finish settling in. His days now began with sipping his morning tea while waiting for the sun to light up the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/docs/goldenboy_factsheet.pdf\">Golden Boy</a> as it serenely overlooked downtown. For the tenth time that day, he made a mental note to thank the friend who had suggested he find a place downtown to start his new life in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Heather’s iPhotos (@heathers.iphotos)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-10T05:13:20+00:00\">Dec 9, 2018 at 9:13pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>Starting a new life in an unfamiliar city can be unnerving. Resources are limited, expectations are high and there is always too much to do. That’s why it is important to choose a location that can help you get things done on the fast track. Living at the heart of the city and near all the major institutions not only saves precious time, but also gives the added advantage of being mobile even if you’re not ready to own a vehicle. It’s cost-effective to be able to walk to most places which is exactly what you’re looking for when starting your life in a new city. Better to burn calories than cents when you’re relying on your savings!</p>\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is also a great place to network, which is invaluable when you’re adjusting to a new culture and looking for a job in your field.

Looking to relax after a long working week? That’s the beauty of downtown: it’s home to a lot of tourist attractions and entertainment spots. Whether it’s a stroll through the beautiful grounds at <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> or a <a href=\"http://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/movies-on-memorial/\">movie in Memorial Park</a>, everything is within reach. If you need to use <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en\">Winnipeg Transit</a>, most major bus routes run right through downtown, making it easy to get around! There are convenient options for grocery shopping, and a plethora of ethnic stores makes for a diverse retail environment that caters to a multicultural community.</p>\n<p>And downtown Winnipeg is exceptionally multicultural. You’ll see Diwali celebrations happening amidst decorations waiting for the Christmas season to gain momentum, and people rushing for Eid prayers right after Easter wraps up. There is something for everyone here: the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/\">Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG)</a> for the art enthusiast who wants to analyse each piece, free yoga classes in Memorial Park for the fitness freak, and tons of delectable dining options for the foodie. And in case you’re all three, everything is always only a few blocks away! <a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/\">The Downtown Winnipeg Biz</a> is a great resource for finding ways to experience the best Winnipeg has to offer.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking about starting a new chapter of your life in Winnipeg, look no further than downtown—and I mean literally!

The area is bustling with development, including <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a>, and 2019 is already shaping up to be jam-packed with events. Here’s a look at some of the great happenings you’ll want to jot down in your calendar.</p>\n<h3>Do You Like Music?</h3>\n<p>There will be concerts galore—including headliners from multiple decades—at <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/\">Bell MTS Place</a>. <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3802297&amp;event=Justin+Timberlake\">Justin Timberlake</a> will be the major draw in February. April sees the legendary <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3824243&amp;event=Fleetwood+Mac\">Fleetwood Mac</a> come to town on the 11th, while Canadian rockers <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3823211&amp;event=Metric\">Metric</a> play on the 23rd. Country sensation <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3659325&amp;event=Carrie+Underwood%2C+Maddie+and+Tae+%26+Runaway+June\">Carrie Underwood</a> comes through on June 2nd. And taking you back to the 1980s is <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3811949&amp;event=Corey+Hart\">Corey Hart</a> on June 18th. If you go, report back on whether he still wears his sunglasses at night. (Sorry. Had to.) To see a full list of events, check out the <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/calendar/\">Bell MTS Place events calendar</a>.</p>\n<h3>Looking for Some Culture?</h3>\n<p>The ballet, opera and symphony all operate out of the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, and with the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/\">Royal Manitoba Theatre Company</a> (Royal MTC) around the corner, there is always something new to watch downtown. The <a href=\"https://buy.rwb.org/single/EventListing.aspx\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> (RWB) performs <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/romeo-juliet/\">Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> February 13th through 17th. I’ve seen this one before and can vouch for the gorgeous costumes and delightful choreography. If you’re looking for a show that will entrance young kids, the RWB will perform <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/the-wizard-of-oz/\">The Wizard of Oz</a> from May 1st to 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbopera.ca/season/the-barber-of-seville/\">Manitoba Opera</a> is putting on one of my favourite operas this spring, The Barber of Seville. This one’s a comedy, so don’t expect a long dirge. When you hear “Figaro, Figaro, Fiiiigaro!” being belted out onstage, you might recognize the famous aria featured in the Looney Tunes “Rabbit of Seville.” <a href=\"https://tickets.mbopera.ca/TheatreManager/1/login?event=281\">The Barber of Seville</a> runs April 6th, 9th and 12th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2605 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical, Musical, Theatre, Show, Downtown Winnipeg, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC), Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-500x171.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-300x103.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-768x263.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1370x470.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Tickets.aspx\">Royal MTC</a> fans, you can catch <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\">Matilda the Musical</a> (based on the Roald Dahl Book) from January 8th to February 2nd . Another option is <a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">A Doll’s House</a> from January 30st to February 16th. I’ve never heard of this one, but the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">description</a> sounds intriguing: “Henrik Ibsen’s realist masterpiece resonates more than a century after the debut of Nora Helmer, whose bourgeois illusions are shattered by the realization that she’s merely a doll in her own home.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO)</a> has events for all tastes throughout the year. The one I find most intriguing <a href=\"https://wso.ca/1819season/\">this season</a> is <a href=\"https://wso.ca/star-wars-star-trek/\">Star Wars vs. Star Trek</a>, running February 22nd to 24th. According to the WSO, “Special guest hosts Brett Megarry and Jeff Braun, from <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/winnipeg/program/couch-potatoes-cjob\">CJOB’s The Couch Potatoes</a>, settle the score with iconic music from both a galaxy far, far away and where no man has gone before.”</p>\n<p>And my last theatre recommendation is the smash musical <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=KinkyBoots&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=\">Kinky Boots</a>. The Centennial Concert Hall’s got this one from April 16th through 21st. I’ve only seen the movie version of this, and it was great. Expect the musical to be even better.</p>\n<h3>Want to Stay Warm and Burn Some Calories?</h3>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0px auto 12px; width: 50px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0px 7px; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by The Forks (@theforkswinnipeg)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-28T18:34:57+00:00\">Dec 28, 2018 at 10:34am PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/red-river-mutual-trail\">Red River Mutual Trail</a> should be open again soon (once we get some colder weather).

We made a game plan and left with our bellies full, ready to take on the night.</p>\n<p>Our next stop was at <a href=\"https://www.graffitigallery.ca/\">Graffiti Gallery</a> (109 Higgins Avenue) for the opening reception of WOMAN GOOD BAD BAD: a series of all-new work by Winnipeg artist <a href=\"https://gabriellewmfunk.com/\">Gabrielle Funk</a>. The gallery floor was deliciously pink, and I fell in love instantly. Abstract pastel graphics on the walls seemed to blend in with the artwork. I later learned that the gallery is modified before every exhibition to match the artwork and create a cohesive experience.</p>\n<p>People milled about the gallery with wine glasses and kombucha bottles, bobbing their heads to music from the DJ in the corner. There were free appetizers and a cash bar, and the artwork itself was beautiful. Most of the paintings were based on friends and family members of the artist, and the faces look extremely realistic yet surreal. Through this show, Funk explores the duality of the conventional representation of women in religion, art, and the media.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2566\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2566\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2566\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Davis Studio Boutique, First Fridays in the Exchange, Exchange District, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-1370x2055.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A collection of painting by artist, Joshua Wilson at tara davis studio boutique.

It’s an eclectic and charming boutique at 246 McDermot Avenue, carrying womenswear, art, accessories, and home décor. The exhibit was called “12”—the 7th annual exhibition of 12 local artists showing 12 small works no larger than 12&#215;12”. One of the collections that caught my attention was by Joshua Wilson, an artist who paints quirky pictures of animals with cigarettes. I really wanted to take home a painting of a crab with a cigarette, but I settled for a pair of mismatched purple socks with cacti on them.</p>\n<p>My friend and I parted ways, and I walked over to <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/cinematheque/\">Cinematheque</a> (304-100 Arthur Street) for my last stop of the night: a screening of <em><a href=\"https://streamingmoviesright.com/us/movie/sorry-to-bother-you\">SORRY TO BOTHER YOU</a></em>, presented by Black Space Winnipeg. I was a little wary of going to this with just my popcorn for company, but in Winnipeg, six degrees of separation is a very real thing. I ran into friends from work and someone I went to school with, so I joined them for the movie.</p>\n<p>Cinematheque is one of those old-school movie theaters that brings back the romance of movie watching. The architecture of the <a href=\"https://art-space.ca/artspace-building/\">ArtSpace</a> building is stunning and the theatres are small and intimate. Before heading into the showing, I stopped at the bar for a glass of wine to go with my popcorn.</p>\n<p>The movie started a little late, but no one seemed to mind. Written and directed by Boots Riley and starring <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3147751/\">Lakeith Stanfield</a>, Sorry to Bother You is a dystopian comedy that addresses societal issues like racism and commercialism. (The ending will leave you feeling unsettled in the best way possible.) It’s both thoughtful and hilarious, with tremendous actors.</p>\n<p>It was almost midnight by the time the movie ended. Over at <a href=\"https://www.thetallestpoppy.com/\">The Tallest Poppy</a> (103 Sherbrook Street), <a href=\"https://www.synonymartconsultation.com/\">Synonym</a>’s First Friday After Party would be just starting to heat up. But after a full evening of soaking up culture and art, I was ready to head back home.</p>\n<p>By midnight, I had only managed to fit in four of the 36 great events happening that night. I hope to go back this week to catch some of the venues I missed.

If an establishment has Delirium at all, it’s almost always <a href=\"https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/delirium-tremens/1039/\">Delirium Tremens</a>. Which is why I was so happy to see that in addition to tapas and wine, Cordova also specializes in Belgian beers—complete with the Delirium sign hanging above the bar! My ecstasy at finding Delirium Nocturnum in Winnipeg aside, Cordova is also a fabulous spot for a nightcap.</p>\n<p>They have an extensive wine selection, carefully crafted cocktails, and delicious tapas. The candlelit atmosphere makes Cordova the perfect spot for an intimate nightcap over a bottle of wine and shared small plates, and it’s a must-stop for any Belgian beer aficionado.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">Smith</a></h3>\n<p>75 Forks Market Rd<br />\nMonday to Thursday, 6:30 am to 11 pm<br />\nFriday to Saturday, 6:30 am to 12 am<br />\nSunday, 7 am to 11 pm<br />\n<a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca\">smithrestaurant.ca</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2056\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2056\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BREdkWXhwJV/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2056\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Winnipeg, Smith Restaurant, Hang out place, Cozy, Lounge\" width=\"940\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-500x325.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-300x195.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg-768x498.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-smithwinnipeg.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @smithwinnipeg on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I realized a few years ago that hotel bars are extremely underrated. They’re usually quiet, relaxed, open late, and offer a great selection of food and drinks and amazing service. Hotel bars just aren’t the first place most people think about when they want to get a drink somewhere! But you don’t need to be a hotel guest to enjoy the hotel bar.</p>\n<p>My favourite hotel bar in the city, and one I’ve been going to for years, is Smith at the <a href=\"https://www.innforks.com/\">Inn at the Forks</a>. The food is phenomenal, and if you’re not up for a meal, they have a large selection of small plates and sides. (My friends and I usually order a bunch of sides to share.) They have great local beers on tap that rotate regularly, a fantastic wine selection, and some seriously good cocktails. Like, seriously good (try the mezcal and beet cocktail). They have a list of classic cocktails and a list of Smith originals. They even have their own gin! Not to mention the décor is sleek and cosy, and no one is going to bug you if you stay in your <a href=\"https://www.thebay.com/\">Hudson’s Bay</a> blanket booth for hours.</p>\n<h4>So on a cold Winnipeg night, after the Jets have once again made their city proud and you’re craving a nightcap to finish off your evening, try something new! Think of a crisp, locally-brewed beer, a cosy speakeasy, a warm tea cocktail, a juicy glass of wine, and delicious late-night food made by some of Winnipeg’s best kitchens. <a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/\">Downtown Winnipeg</a> has a lot to offer if you know where to look…</h4>\n<p>Have you had a tantalizing nightcap at any of Elena’s favourite spots?

Did you know we’ve got our own Ukrainian cultural centre and museum at the edge of downtown? Oseredok has two floors of changing exhibits and a gift shop. The exhibits change every four to six weeks, so you can go back frequently to see new things. During my visit, the second floor held a charming array of quilts, pillows and other stitched items of art.</p>\n<p>The staff members I spoke to were friendly and answered all of my questions. The museum is small, so it’s a great place to go when you want a quick visit. And if you’re trying to save your pennies, good news: visiting Oseredok is free of charge!</p>\n<p>The centre also offers a few public workshops each year, including a chance to learn the art of egg painting at Easter time and how to cook food for Ukrainian Christmas.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>Oseredok is located at 184 Alexander Avenue East. Admission is free. Current visiting hours are Monday to Saturday, 10 am to 4 pm. You can check out the museum online at <a href=\"http://oseredok.ca/\">oseredok.ca</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame</a></h3>\n<p>If you decide to visit Oseredok, you might as well make it a two-for-one day! The</p>\n<p>Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame is just steps away, located in the sparkly new <a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Canada Games Sports for Life Centre</a>.</p>\n<p>Here, you can see some of Manitoba’s sports history and learn about our greatest athletes and sporting achievements. This is another small museum that’s perfect for an afternoon visit.</p>\n<p>The current exhibit looks at Manitoba sports through the decades, with a focus on athletes who also served in Canada’s military. This exhibit is to honour the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War. You’ll get the chance to read about our athletes (including Bobby Hull), view a nice array of sports memorabilia, and watch a video or two. The exhibits change about once per year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-623 size-full\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3702.png\" alt=\"Sport Manitoba, Sport for Life Centre\" width=\"710\" height=\"994\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702.png 710w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-500x700.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-214x300.png 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>The museum and the Canada Games Sports Centre for Life are located at 145 Pacific Avenue at the edge of downtown.

It’s a Victorian house built in 1895 that was occupied by one-time Manitoba premier <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/hugh-john-personal-and-career/\">Hugh John Macdonald</a>, who was also known for his family relations. (His father was Canada’s first prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm\">John A. Macdonald</a>.) Hugh’s family lived in the home until 1929. It was taken over and turned into a museum in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>You can take guided tours through the building, which shows off Victorian architecture and furnishings. It’s a great spot for history and architecture buffs, and the guides are knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. (Guided tours take 45 minutes to an hour)<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-637\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3756.png\" alt=\"Dalnavert Museum, Historic Site, Ancient, Classic Interior\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756.png 1008w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-500x357.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-300x214.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-768x549.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-960x685.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>My favourite reason for visiting Dalnavert is for the events they run throughout the year, especially at Christmas time!</p>\n<p>The museum has done <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/20/a-christmas-carol-reading\">readings of A Christmas Carol</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2017/12/15/its-a-wonderful-life-a-live-radio-play\">radio play version of It’s a Wonderful Life</a>. You can enjoy the festivities while nibbling baked treats and imbibing hot cider, mulled wine or hot chocolate. This year, they’re hosting several lecture series covering topics including <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/11/4/lecture-series-jane-austen-reading-series\">Jane Austen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/16/charles-dickens-the-man-behind-the-carol\">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/2/victorian-ghost-stories\">Victorian ghosts</a>. I attended a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2016/12/12/clue-at-the-museum\">Clue</a> board game night there last year, which featured talented actors playing out the murder scene in different rooms of the mansion!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If You Go</strong></em></p>\n<p>Dalnavert is located at 61 Carlton Street (south of Broadway). Winter visiting hours are Wednesday to Sunday, 12 pm to 4 pm. The hours change throughout the year, so check their website before you go. Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for students and seniors, and</p>\n<p>$4 for children. To find out what intriguing events they have coming up next, visit <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\">friendsofdalnavert.ca</a></p>\n<p>Important note: because they haven’t changed the original structure of the building, the second and third floors are not wheelchair accessible.</p>\n<h4><strong>These Aren’t The Only Museums Downtown!</strong></h4>\n<p>Oseredok, the Sports Hall of Fame and Dalnavert are just three of downtown Winnipeg’s lesser-known museums. There are others you can visit, such as the <a href=\"http://www.wpgrailwaymuseum.com/home.html\">Winnipeg Railway Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/police/Museum/default.stm\">Winnipeg Police Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg is so full of history, we pass by so many of these cultural gems each day without giving them a second glance. If you want to enjoy everything your downtown home has to offer, make sure to visit them!</p>\n<h4><em>Is your personal favourite missing from this list?

Put on your favourite sneakers and your favourite jersey and head out your door to one of these stellar sporting venues.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/jets\">Winnipeg Jets</a>—<a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/\">Bell MTS Place</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"19 Years in the Making...\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pong0814/17194111246/in/photolist-scojeU-fabknM-Vw2E5S-GCUnNE-adG45D-dChbuw-bNw8bV-dP1S6G-8pYEjA-4wYGwD-9s5vk2-mFirb7-dLJJmB-dTVuKn-8UzAtT-eaEHgN-nTrLkN-jqWaLU-bdtgmZ-VqWMS6-HpUD6L-Af9RKH-dtYC62-GkfXvu-8UNoBD-9ybLpf-odBtBV-8yvpk9-YYPcy3-bDw8wP-89YEZU-T8NsuB-26SuCYV-NPuvpN-27NFWbj-71Vf6F-pYR1rU-25rCSAm-bzmH5z-foYfy1-7J7cRK-e1hEuf-dHufBu-d1TFeQ-r1ppFs-dZy8WS-8BE56p-dQa7Pv-QqfwWu-bmEtt9/\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7653/17194111246_1c70208d04_b.jpg\" alt=\"19 Years in the Making...\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>The Winnipeg Jets are, of course, the kings of downtown Winnipeg when it comes to sports. And it’s a well-deserved crown. The Jets have earned a reputation as being one of the best teams in the <a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/\">National Hockey League</a>. With young stars such as Patrik Laine, Nikolaj Ehlers, Mark Scheifele, Kyle Connor and Connor Hellebuyck making headway, this can’t-miss team has been drawing not only national, but world-wide attention for their fast and fluid style of hockey.</p>\n<p>It’s an expensive night out if you plan on taking a date to a Winnipeg Jets game, but it’s usually worth it. In the heart of downtown, there’s no bigger gem than the beautiful Bell MTS Place. Built in 2004 and standing on the former Eatons site, the arena is owned by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, a company which also owns the Winnipeg Jets. They put out a product that is highly entertaining to watch night in and night out; you’ll leave with no regrets.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has a long and rich history of being a serious-minded hockey town, dating back to the early days of the sport when the Winnipeg Victorias won three Stanley Cups in the early 1900’s. Later, in 1920, the Winnipeg Falcons (a team of Icelanders from the West End of town) captured the first-ever Olympic gold medal in ice hockey. It’s only fitting that Winnipeg would erect an enormous hockey arena and stadium right in the centre of its downtown. You can’t be a downtown Winnipegger without taking in at least one Jets game this season.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/recreation-services/duckworth-centre/index.html\">University of Winnipeg—Duckworth Centre</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sangudo/8439115766/in/photolist-dRJF6Y-9Y9KHn-8N7bE8-pVgMqQ-qiT7fm-8dzhLc-owCXRK-9zXNdZ-5WvkZg-ouZHKh-p1RBK8-GsTV7z-q2LE7K-asqBwD-qcz3eT-a1udwZ-ox6TwZ-9Y9D7H-q2uqwa-qaCqU7-9XTmYj-FoWbn-RVuq7V-ofzeaT-q2NkLa-odPGow-FtxtW2-q2Nzve-q2u6Za-qKB2un-oeZ38t-qj3q7e-6TjfKJ-89DAkC-pnaM8a-bHRS2T-pmW7io-6TepQT-oy9MRD-8CAxv7-pmXsGs-pnc2Mt-6TiMnJ-ouCk85-6K5hs2-qcqveo-owqCk4-YoJBW6-pnrSnh-KCiTZW\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8439115766_bcb1f4d59b.jpg\" alt=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>At the University of Winnipeg campus on Portage Avenue you’ll find the beautiful Duckworth Centre, home to the University of Winnipeg’s Wesmen basketball and volleyball teams.

It’s one of the oldest curling clubs in the world and certainly the oldest in Western Canada.</p>\n<p>Affectionately known to curling fans as the &#8220;Mother Club&#8221;, the Granite has produced countless Canadian and world champions. The original Granite Curling Club dates all the way back to 1880. In its current downtown location, the Tudor-framed clubhouse was built in 1913 and is recognized as an official historic site of Manitoba. It is often considered to be the &#8220;St. Andrews&#8221; of curling because of its contribution to the sport in curling&#8217;s mecca.</p>\n<p>If you have a free winter evening and you’re a sports fan looking for something to do, stop on by the Granite and have a drink, watch some curling and have a good time! If you like what you see, sign up for a league and try out the game for yourself. Did you know curling is making a comeback and is one of the fastest growing sports in the prairies? Join the enthusiasm and wrangle in some friends to join a team with you.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/\">Winnipeg Goldeyes—Shaw Park</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/evilfoo/19716053528/in/photolist-w3eVPo-6Lnbv7-cGQoXf-cGQpeC-6ywTJt-cGQptu-eBz8S2-cGQmW3-cGQnwJ-4T86bw-MKkv3-59mv7D-574iVb-p9LAMF-4Amjpk-V5WJFu-o9oecJ-6DWAb5-7GFGnk-cGQiXj-6KrUpV-7mFcWn-oqT3gB-85wggY-cGQq6Q-orFMTB-cFrA7f-a5NTq8-cGQpGQ-6KvYBw-adpH4a-9VC2vz-6KrSQz-6KrXSz-6Ks4HX-22B4uKP-6y8QEt-6KrYkM-56Z8Gx-cGQqUN-6xRZqe-6vJdFJ-3gfQAA-5jGq55-eCVFG6-6KwyN7-21wkAEy-orFMLH-ac8fPj-2kB35B\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/427/19716053528_cdc55240db_b.jpg\" alt=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" width=\"1024\" height=\"311\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>It’s hard to think of a better summertime sports option than watching a Winnipeg Goldeyes game over at Shaw Park. When tickets can be had for as little as $9, it’s a no-brainer for an evening of fun. Centrally located, adjacent to <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> (local beers and snacks of every ethnicity) and across the street from the <a href=\"http://Canadian Museum for Human Rights\">Canadian Museum for Human Rights</a>, you could even make a whole-day excursion out of a Goldeyes Game.</p>\n<p>While Winnipeggers (understandably) tend to fixate on the Jets and their standings, let’s take a moment to point out that the Goldeyes are one of the better baseball teams in the American Association, winning two league championships in the past three years. Even if you’re not an outspoken baseball fan, it’s worth your time just to see former MLB slugger Reggie Abercrombie hit some homeruns for the Goldeyes.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered why they’re called the Goldeyes, anyway? Here’s a piece of sports trivia: The club is named after the goldeye, a fish often served as a smoked delicacy and commonly called Winnipeg Goldeye. So why not take in a Goldeyes’ game and then smoke up some goldeye when you get back to your apartment after the game? That’s the make of a true Winnipegger.</p>\n<p>That’s only the beginning of the list of downtown stops for Winnipeg sports enthusiasts. Comment on your favorite spot for sports in downtown Winnipeg.
