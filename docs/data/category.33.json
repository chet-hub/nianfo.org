The area is bustling with development, including <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a>, and 2019 is already shaping up to be jam-packed with events. Here’s a look at some of the great happenings you’ll want to jot down in your calendar.</p>\n<h3>Do You Like Music?</h3>\n<p>There will be concerts galore—including headliners from multiple decades—at <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/\">Bell MTS Place</a>. <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3802297&amp;event=Justin+Timberlake\">Justin Timberlake</a> will be the major draw in February. April sees the legendary <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3824243&amp;event=Fleetwood+Mac\">Fleetwood Mac</a> come to town on the 11th, while Canadian rockers <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3823211&amp;event=Metric\">Metric</a> play on the 23rd. Country sensation <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3659325&amp;event=Carrie+Underwood%2C+Maddie+and+Tae+%26+Runaway+June\">Carrie Underwood</a> comes through on June 2nd. And taking you back to the 1980s is <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3811949&amp;event=Corey+Hart\">Corey Hart</a> on June 18th. If you go, report back on whether he still wears his sunglasses at night. (Sorry. Had to.) To see a full list of events, check out the <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/calendar/\">Bell MTS Place events calendar</a>.</p>\n<h3>Looking for Some Culture?</h3>\n<p>The ballet, opera and symphony all operate out of the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, and with the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/\">Royal Manitoba Theatre Company</a> (Royal MTC) around the corner, there is always something new to watch downtown. The <a href=\"https://buy.rwb.org/single/EventListing.aspx\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> (RWB) performs <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/romeo-juliet/\">Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> February 13th through 17th. I’ve seen this one before and can vouch for the gorgeous costumes and delightful choreography. If you’re looking for a show that will entrance young kids, the RWB will perform <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/the-wizard-of-oz/\">The Wizard of Oz</a> from May 1st to 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbopera.ca/season/the-barber-of-seville/\">Manitoba Opera</a> is putting on one of my favourite operas this spring, The Barber of Seville. This one’s a comedy, so don’t expect a long dirge. When you hear “Figaro, Figaro, Fiiiigaro!” being belted out onstage, you might recognize the famous aria featured in the Looney Tunes “Rabbit of Seville.” <a href=\"https://tickets.mbopera.ca/TheatreManager/1/login?event=281\">The Barber of Seville</a> runs April 6th, 9th and 12th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2605 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical, Musical, Theatre, Show, Downtown Winnipeg, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC), Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-500x171.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-300x103.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-768x263.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1370x470.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Tickets.aspx\">Royal MTC</a> fans, you can catch <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\">Matilda the Musical</a> (based on the Roald Dahl Book) from January 8th to February 2nd . Another option is <a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">A Doll’s House</a> from January 30st to February 16th. I’ve never heard of this one, but the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">description</a> sounds intriguing: “Henrik Ibsen’s realist masterpiece resonates more than a century after the debut of Nora Helmer, whose bourgeois illusions are shattered by the realization that she’s merely a doll in her own home.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO)</a> has events for all tastes throughout the year. The one I find most intriguing <a href=\"https://wso.ca/1819season/\">this season</a> is <a href=\"https://wso.ca/star-wars-star-trek/\">Star Wars vs. Star Trek</a>, running February 22nd to 24th. According to the WSO, “Special guest hosts Brett Megarry and Jeff Braun, from <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/winnipeg/program/couch-potatoes-cjob\">CJOB’s The Couch Potatoes</a>, settle the score with iconic music from both a galaxy far, far away and where no man has gone before.”</p>\n<p>And my last theatre recommendation is the smash musical <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=KinkyBoots&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=\">Kinky Boots</a>. The Centennial Concert Hall’s got this one from April 16th through 21st. I’ve only seen the movie version of this, and it was great. Expect the musical to be even better.</p>\n<h3>Want to Stay Warm and Burn Some Calories?</h3>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0px auto 12px; width: 50px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0px 7px; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by The Forks (@theforkswinnipeg)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-28T18:34:57+00:00\">Dec 28, 2018 at 10:34am PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/red-river-mutual-trail\">Red River Mutual Trail</a> should be open again soon (once we get some colder weather). Head down to the Forks to rent some skates and check out the world-famous <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts</a>. There are five new ones this year, including a performance hut. Norwegian ice musician <a href=\"https://wso.ca/blog/wnmf-2019-preview/\">Terje Isunget</a> will perform with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra using instruments carved from Red River ice. Sounds fascinating to me!</p>\n<p>If you want more exercise, you can always sign up for the <a href=\"https://wildwintercanoerace.com/\">Wild Winter Canoe Race</a> at <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/a-z-guide/\">Shaw Park</a> on February 16th. This involves finding a group of friends to “canoe” across the snow. (You move the canoe with your feet, like the most Canadian skateboard ever.) No need to bring your own canoe; the event will provide one for you. You can win great prizes and bragging rights.</p>\n<h3>Need Some Home Renovation or Wedding Ideas?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://winnipegrenovationshow.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2606 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png\" alt=\"Winnipeg Renovation Show, Downtown Winnipeg, RBC Convention Centre, Apartment Living, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Events, Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1021\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-500x156.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-300x93.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-768x239.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are, look no further than the <a href=\"https://www.wcc.mb.ca/\">RBC Convention Centre</a>.
