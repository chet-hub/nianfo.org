When it comes to the best fishing spots, there is somewhere to go in any part of the province and cities that make it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Father and son walking with fishing gear towards a lake\" class=\"wp-image-7905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post6.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are going to try and make the most of fishing in Manitoba, you can quickly turn your plans into a day or weekend trip. With many of our best hot spots being within 10 to 45 minutes of not only Winnipeg but each other, you can easily plan either a day or weekend of fishing throughout Manitoba this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about these Manitoba attractions is they have much more to offer than a great catch.

Lockport holds a high reputation for its fishing and diners, making it a great all-day experience. Lockport has always been famous for its two vintage diners, Skinners and the Half Moon. While Skinner&#8217;s historic waterslide may be shut down, you can still enjoy Skinners Diner in full swing serving its world-famous foot-long hot dogs and delicious shakes while listening to your table&#8217;s jukebox in its classic 50s themed (more like preserved) diner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png\" alt=\"Couple drinking milk shake\" class=\"wp-image-7910\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-1024x672.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-300x197.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-770x506.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-293x192.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-500x328.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-91x60.png 91w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11-137x90.png 137w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/Post11.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After dinner and less than just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Skinners is the Half Moon drive-in. With delicious food and shakes, and certainly not any less famous than its sister, is this other local legend.

So don’t knock it till you try it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like trying new things and want to improve the quality of your life, make this spring all about experimenting with different ways to make your home smell amazing. And there are quite a few ways so you can pick and choose depending on your taste and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7565\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/1.jpg 1241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My personal favorite is the diffuser. So subtle and yet so powerful. And honestly, there is something so calming about looking at all the mist that flows out. I often catch myself just staring at it.  You can choose whatever combination of essential oils you like, or you can swap them around depending on your mood and time of day. Something is calming like peppermint for a meditation or yoga session and maybe some lavender for when you want to curl up on the sofa with a cup of green tea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to try out different scents till you find ‘the one.’ You can also choose to put smaller diffusers around the apartment and in the bathrooms when you’re having guests over. Everyone loves to be greeted with a fresh scent, whether they are entering the main door or the bathroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of aromatherapy are numerous. It can help you relax, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety—all great things in today’s stressful and fast lifestyle. After a tiring day, you would want to come back to your little haven. And let’s be honest, no one likes a stinky haven. And the good news is, there is no one right way to make your home smell good. There are so many options out there that you’re bound to find one that suits your needs and lifestyle. You just have to take the first step to find out what works best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7566\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scented candles are another way to make your living space smell heavenly, especially if you’re the kind of person who likes warm tones. You can try out vanilla if you want to go subtle, cinnamon for a spicier feel, and flowery scents if you really want to feel like spring is in the air or in your living room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candles also really add some personality to a living room. They come in different sizes and styles, so you can choose a minimalistic version that is not too conspicuous or go for something fancy if you really want people to notice the source of the heavenly scent that will be coming from your home this spring!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1344\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7567\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/3.jpg 1344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Burning incense can also be an interesting way to freshen up the scent in your home. It can help to reduce anxiety and would go well with a meditation session. The scented smoke would work well for a spiritual purpose, but if you are sensitive to inhaling smoke, then this might not be the best option for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a DIY kind of person and like to keep things basic, just throw in some orange and lemon slices with cinnamon sticks in a pot of water and let it boil. Your kitchen will smell of citrusy and cinnamon goodness in no time! Or better yet, bake a batch of cookies if you really want some authentic vanilla and cinnamon scent in the kitchen and also have something to munch on while you enjoy the yummy smell!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If candles and diffusers are too much for you and you are looking for a more subtle way to improve the way your home smells, then reed diffusers might be your best bet. They look classy, the fragrance isn’t too strong, and there are a lot of options to choose from! Also, if you like being safe, there are no flames or electric plug-ins involved, so you don’t have to worry about switching it off or blowing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-1024x687.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7568\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-300x201.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-770x516.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4-500x335.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/03/4.jpg 1299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to really get creative and enjoy a great smelling room is to make your own room spray! How cool is that! It’s definitely on my list for this spring! You can control how strong you want the scent to be, what your favorite blend might be, and just imagine the possibilities! Once you come up with a winning combination, you can make cute little spray bottles and pass them on to family and friends so they, too, can feel like spring really is in the air. Of their own homes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Spring towards a brand-new scent.

And it&#8217;s not just for the environment. It provides an efficient alternative to driving, whether it can help alleviate concerns about parking or digging your car out in wintertime while saving money on gas prices! Let&#8217;s not forget that biking and walking also promote healthy living by getting some daily body movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Host with the most</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who live Downtown often forget how much their residences appeal to friends and family members who want quick access into the city. Rather than lamenting another trip out into sleepy suburbs, your friends and family will be waiting with excited anticipation for your next visit!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-1024x614.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7472\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-300x180.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/02/dinner-with-friends-group-of-young-people-enjoyin-2021-10-21-03-07-24-utc-770x461.jpg 770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The city is your oyster.

One possibility is green areas and parks that contrast sharply with many people&#8217;s image for city life.

In 2021 Winnipeggers enjoyed 30 new trails in parks for skiing, walking, and fat-biking, 13 dog parks, and 49 community gardens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s not simply the presence of a park or two but an entire system with open fields for sports and tree-covered benches to lounge upon.

Are you thinking about setting resolutions for 2022? With all the lockdown and pandemic talk (still) happening, this might be more difficult than in previous years. Are the gyms going to close again? Will I be able to start that new food lifestyle? Will I even be able to make it to Tulum this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we all wait for that &#8220;new normal,&#8221; we have the opportunity to reframe how we experience where we are now. For me, 2021 presented me with the chance to rethink resolutions. I decided to focus on building in more holistic practices rather than individual goals. I swapped out &#8220;gym three times a week&#8221; with &#8220;move daily.&#8221; Building better habits into day-to-day activities allowed me to actually hold to my new year&#8217;s resolutions. Because of this, I have been happier and healthier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7342\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b2-1.jpg 1625w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are five resolutions worth keeping and implementing into your daily life. There are a few things to remember when setting any resolutions. First, set a limit on how many goals you are looking to make. Next, make your resolutions specific. When I changed my resolution to moving daily, I also made sure to add for a minimum of 15 min a day. For all you fitness buffs, I know 15 min is about half of the recommended movement time, but the pandemic was hard and, I sat a lot. This brings me to the next point, start small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few of us can successfully go from 0 to 100 overnight. By the end of 2021, I was moving for over an hour a day, but I started at 15 minutes. Finally, stay open and get help. Having an accountability partner (or app) helps hold you to your goals. The extra support is helpful when those resolutions start to feel hard. Change can be challenging. Having someone to support you through change is an important aspect of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few resolutions to help you along your journey in 2022. Good luck, you&#8217;ve got this! &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Move</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, this is not a traditional resolution of going to the gym three times a week. This resolution is just about moving your body, even if it is up and down the hallways a couple of times. The past few years have been passed sitting in a chair sitting for many people. It&#8217;s time to get active again. The physical and mental benefits of activity of any type are important, but how we get the activity is less important.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b3-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7337\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b3-1.jpg 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad always parks in the furthest spot at the store so he can get his steps in. I prefer a dance party in the living room. It doesn&#8217;t always have to be treadmills and barbells. The key to this resolution is to commit to moving your body regularly simply. Let the type of movement you are doing evolve as you get stronger and keep going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pay it forward</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This resolution is all about finding space to give back. The pandemic has been draining for many people. Some of us have experienced it much worse than others. I know that every canceled holiday plan has been exhausting for me. This is why acts of kindness need to be built into your new year. Think about those videos of people buying meals for someone they have never met or pets howling, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b4-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7338\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b4-1.jpg 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those little moments where you want to say, &#8220;aww, that&#8217;s so sweet.&#8221; Try building in a giving practice into your new year. We need more kind moments to continue through the pandemic. Try leaving a note (or text) for someone you know has been having a hard time. Donate to or volunteer for a local organization. Or call your mom. Whatever it is, everyone could use an act of kindness in their lives. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do one green thing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global warming is real. The abnormally hot summers say so. This year, commit to being a bit more green. This doesn&#8217;t mean you immediately have to become a master composter. It means trying out high-efficiency bulbs and recycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b5-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7339\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b5-2.jpg 1750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or it could mean walking to the store (and getting in movement minutes). I am working on switching out cleaning products to eco-friendly products. I also used last year to start a garden. This resolution is about finding a way to get a bit greener.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start a mindfulness practice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness practices are not new. There are traditions dating back thousands of years. This is why I can bet there is something out there that would work for every person. There is enough diversity in practices to create something that feels true for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b6-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7340\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b6-1.jpg 1479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of mindfulness are endless – stress relief, better sleep, improved mental, physical, and social health, to name a few. For some, diving into a yogic lifestyle and meditation is the way to go. For others, the namastes and cross-legged poses aren&#8217;t a fit. Mindfulness is really about slowing down and experiencing every moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many apps and sites where you can get the how-tos of developing a practice but again, start small. Maybe starting practice for you this year means breathing deeply three times when you feel mad, anxious, or overly excited. For others, mindfulness this year could mean cutting out multi-tasking and focussing in on one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try something new</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use this year as an opportunity to check something off your bucket list. With businesses reopening and a growing number of online classes from around the world, now is a great chance to learn that new skill. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7341\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/b7.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this your mental workout.

If you didn’t have time or energy to make your home your winter wonderland and are feeling overwhelmed, I’ve curated a few -easy- tips to make your home décor a little more winter-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7220\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter1-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Light, Scent, and set the Mood with Candles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing sets more a cozier mood than candles. Used all year long, your candle’s size, shape, and smell vary depending on your taste. However, the idea is to use it to highlight those winter prime spaces, like fireplaces, mantels, and shelves, to make your apartment or house even cozier. Keep the colors on the light and bright side for a minimalist look. Scents like peppermint, pine, and apple are great options to fill your home with the perfect winter vibe. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7221\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter2-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make a wreath</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The front door is the first impression of your home. So why leave it out of the décor plan? The good thing about wreaths is that many options for inexpensive DIYs are available, so there are no excuses not to give them a try. &nbsp;Experiment with different materials like grapevine, Styrofoam, pinecones, or even cardboard. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7222\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter3-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Throw a blanket</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! It’s that time of the year where we are so proud of our chunky knit blanket. If you don’t have the chunky one, any type will do it. Throw it on your sofa, stool, or bed. The blanket will add a touch of winter décor to your space with an inexpensive, warming, and elegant result.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7223\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter5-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowers, plants, and greenery</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t wait for the Spring to enjoy your pretty flowers. Many flowers and plants survive and even thrive during winter’s cold weather<a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/amazing-houseplants-that-will-survive-the-cold-weather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">. <strong>A few days ago, we posted the best houseplants to survive the winter</strong></a>, but now we invite you to give it a try and decorate your home with flowers, foliage, or plants that will brighten up the cold season. To create a cozier look, choose earthier or white colors for flowers. Another good idea is to create a winter arrangement with bright foliage, branches, and berries.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7224\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter6-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Table décor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter, especially the holiday season, is a perfect time to celebrate with family and friends. Whether you are throwing a Christmas party or simply adding beauty to your dining room, there are many ways to style your table. From centerpieces made of greenery, candles, and pinecones to simple ideas like napkin arrangements or DIY paper houses, your table décor is a must to give a stylish feel to your winter wonderland.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/winter4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7225\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/winter4-500x332.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bring the Outdoors in</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun idea to give your house a wintery feeling is to bring outdoor elements inside. Rocks, firewood, pinecones, and leaves can create a cozier environment and add a cabin vibe to your favorite space. Keeping firewood displayed or winter greenery in ceramic vases adds another layer of natural textures to even the most urban of the homes.   </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter is just around the corner, and this is the most beautiful season for many winter-lovers.

I prefer to hunker down for the cold months and try learning a couple of new things. That is how I found myself in a slow cooker frenzy and boldly declaring, “I will never use another device again”. The convenience of one-pot meals and the diversity of use make the slow cooker one of my favorite cooking tools. It is slow to warm up, but once it does, things get hot. That is why I am presenting you with five great ways to use your slow cooker to turn up the cozy this winter season.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sc1-1024x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7321\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1-300x221.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1-770x567.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1-1536x1131.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1-293x216.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1-1400x1031.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1-500x368.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc1.jpg 1624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dessert for breakfast?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love warm oatmeal in the winter to kickstart my day. The rich nuttiness of the oats with some milk and a bit of brown sugar are undefeated against a cold winter morning. A slow cooker is best for cooking steel-cut oats that are a bit denser and can keep the chewiness after being cooked over a long period. On average, you will want to use 3 ½ to 4 cups of liquid for every one cup of oats depending on the size of your cooker and your desired texture.  For the liquid, you can use water or any of your favorite kinds of milk. I prefer a mix of almond milk and coconut milk. After that, it is just choosing your toppings! From classics like pecans and raisins to items like carrot and coconut chips, oatmeal allows you to mix and match to your heart&#8217;s content. Don’t forget to throw in a sweetener of choice and a few herbs or spices like cardamom or nutmeg. Get creative and try something new. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.ihearteating.com/overnight-crock-pot-carrot-cake-oatmeal/\">overnight slow cooker carrot cake oatmeal</a> recipe by Kate Dean from I Heart Eating and try a little dessert for breakfast this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beans will make you dance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID brought on a lot of changes for everyone. For me, given the extra time I had at home, I decided to transition into a vegetarian lifestyle. What this meant was experimenting with new recipes and very often, beans. Cue the slow cooker. Over the last year, I have tried a variety of slow cooker bean dishes from chili to stew. Now, when I think about a go-to slow cooker meal, I immediately think of a warm chickpea coconut curry! This dish is a staple in my meal plan, popping up every couple of months. The rich curry flavor always transports me to another, much warmer, place, and in the dead of winter, that is where I want to be. Served on a bed of rice or with a side of naan bread, this dish is all comfort. I often pair mine with some garlic roasted green beans or oven-roasted broccoli. To get your curry on, pick up some potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, ginger, and coconut milk. Again, thanks to the one-pot meal idea, all you have to do is prep the veggies and dump them all into the pot.

But did you know that your slow cooker can also make a variety of desserts and types of bread? That’s right, brownies, focaccia, French toast, and cakes can all be prepared in a slow cooker. As a big fan of dessert, slow cooker puddings and pies have been an exciting new way to cook some of my favorite sweets. I find that cooking with a slow cooker means that burning my baking is much less likely thanks to the slow cooking time. I also love that using the slow cooker frees up the oven for other tasks, which comes in handy during the busy Christmas baking season. Making dessert in a slow cooker is a bit more involved than a one-pot meal. You still need to prep the ingredients outside of the pot as you normally would, but then you can stick it into the pot to cook.

While I often choose a cup of tea, sometimes I like to change things up. Hot toddies mulled wines, and boozy hot chocolates are all beverages that help warm me up while I wind down. These are also all drinks that can easily be prepared in a slow cooker! I mix mine at lunch which guarantees an after-dinner serving time that is still hot out the pot. With slow cooker beverages, we can return to the one-pot meal idea and get creative with mix-ins. Want to try a mint hot chocolate, or ginger-spiced mulled wine? You can easily adapt any base recipe with your favorite flavors. Just stay open to the possibilities and adjust along the way. Stay warm with this <a href=\"https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/mulled-wine-recipe/\">mulled wine recipe</a> from Gimme Some Oven.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sc3-1024x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7323\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3-300x221.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3-770x567.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3-1536x1131.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3-293x216.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3-1400x1031.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3-500x368.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/sc3.jpg 1624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hygge for all</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the dishes that have been presented will keep your belly warm and that serotonin flowing. But to create that real winter hygge (a Danish word meaning a quality of coziness and comfort that creates a feeling of contentment or well-being according to dictionary.com) you need to set the scene. While your slow cooker can make food items, it can also make candles, lotion bars, and soaps! That’s right, you can set the scene for your winter wonderland with these DIY household items. When creating a non-food product in your cooker, you will want to be sure to use a liner where possible to avoid cross-contamination and for easy clean-up. These are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased online or from the kitchen aisle in your local grocery store. I love candle-making. They make great gifts, are pretty easy to make, and they smell great! Soaps and lotion bars are also great gift ideas and allow you to exercise your creative side. Check out these <a href=\"https://helloglow.co/how-to-make-diy-candles-in-a-slow-cooker/\">DIY slow cooker candles</a> from Hello Glow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope these ideas inspired your inner chef and you get a chance to try out some of these slow cooker recipes this winter.

Seven-foot self-lighting tree? Check. Popcorn tinsel? Done. An RWG Christmas (red, white, and green) gives you the chance to slide into the holiday season easily with pre-packaged décor and maybe a pine branch or two from your local coniferous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Try making your space look more festive with some traditional Christmas garnishes. Hang a stocking by the fire (or TV stand), throw up some mistletoe (for that special someone who walks through the door), and grab a couple of empty boxes to wrap and place beneath your tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: You can’t do traditional Christmas without a Christmas ham or turkey. For those looking for a vegetarian option, why not try a nut loaf as a savory alternative. For those who want to keep it simple, try one of the holiday feature meal kits from local restaurants like <a href=\"https://localpubliceatery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Local Public Eatery</a>. Pair your dinner with your favorite sides like mash potatoes, some greens, and a dinner roll (or two). Pick up a bottle of wine from <a href=\"https://www.ellementwine.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ellement</a> at the Forks. Wrap this meal up with some holiday sweets from local bakeries like <a href=\"https://tallgrassbakery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tall Grass Prairie</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xn--gtowpg-wta.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gato Bakeshop</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep friends and family entertained with an ugly sweater contest or a gingerbread house-building competition. You might just want to crack out a board game and play until the night runs dry. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7269\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty2.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tinsel and Tini</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to zhuzh things up this holiday season? Test out a Tinsel and Tini party that will give you a chance to crack out the sparkles and get a bit fancy. Think New Years&#8217; Eve at Christmas!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: While a classic pine is usually a go-to, an all-white tree will allow your Tinsel and Tinis party to shine. Dress it up with some silver and white decorations that shimmer like the snow on a sunny day. Pair this with a tinsel garland held together with a few logs of white birch and a couple of soy candles from <a href=\"https://www.coalandcanary.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Coal and Canary</a>. Tip: add in some hints of gold and pine green to tie this look together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: A Tinsel and Tini party is all about the Martinis. Test out your bartending skills with a few different options like this <a href=\"https://inspiredbycharm.com/white-christmas-martini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White Martini</a> from Inspired Charm or these <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/g2881/christmas-martinis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">holiday-inspired mixes</a> posted by Town &amp; Country. As for what to eat? Do dinner differently with a choose-your-own-adventure tapas bar. &nbsp;Keep it Christmas by throwing in some slices of turkey, a few dinner rolls, and some green and red olives. Top off the platter with some white chocolate bark or macaroons from <a href=\"https://www.caroonbymj.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caroon by MJ</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Keep this party focussed on the sips and dips by hosting a DIY martini bar! Throw in fondue and keep your guest full of laughs from mishaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7270\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty3.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nutcracker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s annual show, this theme allows you to tap into your artistic side and get busy with some DIY. Think sugar plum fairies, kingdoms and crowns, and a magic wand to bring it all to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: As with most of these themes, it starts with a tree, and this time, the bigger, the better. Dress your majestic coniferous in gold and wrap the base in crimson. Flank this tree with a couple of nutcracker soldiers, throw on some candy canes and add an angel on top. Hang those stockings and use a bit of extra fabric to create a luxurious garland for your “fireplace”. The key to this Christmas theme is decadence and extravagance. Make this party feel authentic by picking up a few antiques from <a href=\"https://www.thingsforrwb.com/?fbclid=IwAR0S4bGw8NmQXGkstmSPZXXLDCqKBrsirUodsSPo1lgxDmtvcWvomNqOR28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Things by RWB</a>. Remember to watch out for that Rat King though, he might try to steal all your goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Get into the theme by trying a few meat pies from local vendor <a href=\"http://www.mollysmeatpies.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Molly’s Meat Pies</a>. Pair these with some mushroom soup (my favorite is from <a href=\"https://earls.ca/locations/main-street/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Earl’s on Main Street</a>!) and a side of green beans. Grab a sip of your favorite vodka and try your hand at some homemade marzipan or sugar plums. Or you could just eat the candy canes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: What better way to get into character than by hosting a dress-up party? Have people come in their best nutcracker-inspired couture and dance the night away. You could even throw in a crown-making activity to see who really will be crowned the next Rat King!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7272\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-770x559.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-293x213.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-1400x1017.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1-500x363.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/Xmasparty4-1.jpg 1534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>True North</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for something a bit more low-key? Why not think about an all-Canadian Christmas theme that screams cozy and cute with a little bit of camp? That’s right, we are talking about plaid wrapped in twine and drizzled in snowflakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decorations: Get that tree up and dress it in plaid and gold ribbons and bows. Feel free to paint the tips with a bit of white to make it look like it has just snowed. Those plaid stockings with the buck cut-out hung together with a few strings of twine would make a fine addition. If you want to get into the spirit, why not up the ante with a couple of hand-carved pieces from the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/qaumajuq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Winnipeg Art Gallery</a> in support of the new Qaumajuq gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food: Is it too much of a cliché to call on poutine, Bannock, and bacon, and beers? I don’t think so. Stay cozy and homey by serving up these Canadian favorites with a side of split pea soup. To end the evening, fire up the kettle and serve a round of hot toddies (maple syrup required) with a couple of butter tarts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities: Who can say no to a poutine station? Head down to the <a href=\"https://thecheesemongers.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cheesemongers Fromagerie</a> on Corydon and pick up some of your favorite poutine toppings. End this evening with a gift exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you choose to do, have a very happy holiday with your nearest and dearest!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can smell it in the air – the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season.

The dry air and fewer hours of light aren&#8217;t the best environments for most plants. However, some indoor household plants are best suited for even the chillier rooms. Check out the top 6 cold-tolerant plants that are sure to make your house cozier and brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Snake Plant</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plan1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7206\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plan1-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Snake plant (Sansevieria) can resist low light, cool temperatures, and dry soil.

Even though it is suited for chillier areas, it needs a few hours of daily sunshine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jade</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7208\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant3-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jade (Crassula Ovata) is known for gracefully tolerating winter and summer. This thick-leaves plant, like the Geranium, needs light to survive. Well-drained soil is essential for Jade, and you should consider watering it once every two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maidenhair Fern</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7209\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant4-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Need a plant that will thrive in a low-light environment? Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum) is your choice. This plant can survive with indirect light, but it&#8217;s essential to keep the soil humid, so it must be watered consistently and frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Succulents</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7210\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant5-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With many colors, patterns, and styles to choose from, succulents are probably the easiest indoor plants to take care of.  Succulents will survive dry, cold environments and are a good option if you like to leave your plants on your windowsill. You can create a succulent terrarium, mixing and matching the different styles of these incredible and resilient plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fiddle Leaf </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plant6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7211\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/12/plant6-500x360.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While certain plants grow during the winter, that is not the case with Fiddle Leaf (Ficus Lirata). Because of that, you need to adjust the watering for the cold season, reducing the plant&#8217;s watering to once every month if the room isn&#8217;t too humid. This plant likes consistent sunlight, so it is recommended to place it in a south-facing window.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For Winnipeggers, keeping the greenery in their homes throughout the cold months of winter can seem challenging.

The WAG does free exhibits and days (selected dates), as well as a discounted rate on the first Wednesday of the month for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. But there are many other museums Downtown you can check out that offer cheap or free admission, such as the Winnipeg Police Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.

Take a Downtown Patio Crawl</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy a stroll downtown and some of Winnipeg&#8217;s best food and patios on a Downtown patio crawl.

I found lots of recipes that serve up bite-sized portions on lettuce leaves, crackers, even potato salad <em>inside another tiny potato </em>(I didn’t even know you could <em>do</em> that!). However, all of this re-portioning is finicky and I’m not about that life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, for my summer BBQs, I’m opting for things <em>already</em> personally portioned. There’s none of this going back to divvy things up, or repurposing upside down muffin tins to try to make parmesan cheese cups or something (which sound incredible!) Props to you if you want to go through that process, but that’s too tedious for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll lay out my top picks, so whatever you’ve volunteered (or been voluntold) to bring, you’ve got options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Salad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t want to bash salad too hard; there are many enjoyable salads &#8211; taco salad for instance. Also, potato salad, pasta salad, I love me a good corn and black bean salad. A bowl of lettuce and loosely chopped veggies though? I’m not into it. I digress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What <em>does</em> work for me?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-10 wp-block-gallery-9 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"732\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/saladroll.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6921\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/saladroll.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6921\" class=\"wp-image-6921\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll.png 732w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-300x221.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-293x216.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/saladroll-500x369.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Salad Rolls</strong> &#8211; luscious rice paper wrapped delicacies filled with vermicelli, fresh herbs, pickled veggies and BBQ pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are a summer staple in my home. Be warned that if you opt to make them yourself, rice paper wraps are delicate and can be difficult to work with. They’re always tasty but often mine aren’t what you’d call <em>pretty</em>. You may want to try out a few before making a batch to present to the family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is home to some outstanding Vietnamese restaurants. Call ahead and order enough for the whole crew! Pick them up on your way over, and arrive at your party as a hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Sides</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, proteins are the star of the show, but what would they be without the support of some stellar side dishes? I suggest:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Devilled Eggs</strong> &#8211; If there was ever a time for the return of this devillishy delectable appetizer it’s now. Half a hard-boiled egg filled with creamy, seasoned yolk is a tantalizing, two bite snack. I’ll admit I’ve not made these myself. But, as someone who very much wants to eat these, I strongly encourage this choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that isn’t your style, how about&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers</strong> &#8211; These I <em>have</em> made, and they’re legendary (or maybe legen-DAIRY! Spoiler, they’re filled with cheese). To make these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Gut your jalapenos.<ol><li>I recommend wearing disposable gloves for this. Cut them in half and remove the pith (white bit) and seeds to reduce the worst of the heat.</li></ol><ol><li>If you’re really spice intolerant (like me) you can place the de-seeded peppers in boiling water for a few minutes to mellow them out.</li></ol></li><li>Fill them with a combination of your favorite cheeses.<ol><li>I recommend mixing shreds of a strong flavoured cheese like a smoked gouda or fresh parmesan up with some cream cheese, salt, and pepper for a scoopable cheesy filling.</li></ol></li><li>Wrap the filled jalapeno halves with a strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick.<ol><li>You still want it to be pliable enough to wrap, but I recommend partially cooking the bacon first to cut down on finishing time later.</li></ol></li><li>Bake in the oven or set on the grill until the bacon is fully cooked and voilà! You can’t go wrong with bacon and cheese.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have the time or the gumption for all that work, here are some simpler and just as appetizing appetizers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corn on the cob</strong> &#8211; This straightforward and classic BBQ staple is great on its own or can be jazzed up a ton of different ways. Try adding ingredients like lime juice and sweet chili sauce, or ranch and cheddar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-12 wp-block-gallery-11 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"980\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pineapple.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6923\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pineapple.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6923\" class=\"wp-image-6923\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple.png 980w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/pineapple-500x333.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grilled Pineapple</strong> &#8211; Slice off rounds of this hearty fruit and throw them on the grill. When you take them off, finish with a sprinkle of cinnamon for a side that’s as delicious as it is easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mains</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect to see the regulars at BBQs this summer &#8211; hot dogs, burgers, steak, and chicken. But if you want to avoid the usual burger assembly with shared condiments and a pile of communal lettuce, may I suggest:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Stuffed Peppers </em></strong>&#8211; robust self-contained meals that need no accoutrement. Traditionally they’re filled with a mixture of ground beef, rice, and tomato sauce, then topped with cheese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t let that limit you though &#8211; you can pack these bad boys with whatever you want. I did a combination of pulled pork, mushrooms, and rice last week and they were <em>amazing!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key when grilling these is to make sure that the filling isn’t runny so it doesn’t all pour out when you tip it on its side. I recommend cooking these for a bit in a pan or on the cool side of the grill to soften the peppers, and then finishing them off over the flames for those ever-appealing grill lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Desserts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was so hard not to focus this whole thing on desserts. I recognize that people like to eat other things too, but why bother when you could just have dessert?!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a baker, cakes and pies can be scaled down to <strong>cupcakes or tarts</strong>. I really like the idea of having a whole (albeit tiny) pie all to myself! Everyone loves a cupcake, and I’ve got a foolproof recipe to please any crowd. For a ridiculously simple and customizable cupcake:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Take a box of white cake mix and ignoring the additional ingredients it calls for, combine it with any 355 ml can of soda you like to make the batter.</li><li>Then, dish the batter into your pans and bake according to the box instructions for a soft, fluffy, and soda flavored cake.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a batch of root beer float cupcakes this way and topped them with homemade swiss meringue buttercream frosting (which held up impeccably in the heat!). Don’t worry, a can of your favorite store bought frosting will work just as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For something a little lighter, Pinterest inspired an <strong>ice cream cone fruit salad </strong>which is (as you might expect) an ice cream cone filled with whatever fruits and berries you like. Top them with a little of <strong>Mama Dawn’s Famous Fruit Dip</strong>. It’s a quick recipe:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Take a 250 ml container of sour cream and stir in 2 tablespoons of brown sugar until completely combined.</li><li>Taste and add additional sugar if desired.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Downtown Winnipeg hosts a plethora of fantastic bakeries and confectionery shops where you can pick up a stunning contribution to the party with none of that extra effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is one more very important food category that has not been addressed yet:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"812\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kebab2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6924\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2.png 812w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-293x196.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/kebab2-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Anything on a stick!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kebabs</strong> are the ultimate individual BBQ food, and if you can put it on a stick, it can be kebab’d. They’re perfect for an appetizer, main dish or even dessert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine sausage, steak, shrimp, or chicken with your favourite veggies &#8211; tomatoes, pineapple, onion, peppers, etc. &#8211; and you have yourself a killer kebab!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite combination has to be the Manitoba kebab, complete with Farmer sausage and mini perogies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For something more refreshing, try a kebab with watermelon and some cubed feta cheese. Or, you can load up some marshmallows and chocolate for a s’more stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get creative! When it comes to kebabs, the skewer’s the limit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps to inspire some great barbeque grub! With individual options for everyone, you can focus less on shared cutlery and more on shared conversations. Happy barbequing!</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Barbecuing is already the quintessential summer activity.

It is not because such things as eating passion fruit gelato can be done in July particularly (after all, who would in a right mind choose that flavour during Christmas time?), but because choosing fruit flavours ice cream as well as eating on the patio makes sense in Winnipeg only during the hot season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons why Manitobans await summertime with such thirst and desire; one of them is anticipation of sitting on a patio with friends and family while sipping on craft cocktails. To add to the usual excitement of moments when patios start opening in the late spring, this season we also receive them with open arms because restaurants have been closed for an extended period. Today, we prepared a list of five famous downtown restaurants with available patio seating and the finest cuisines.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6916\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/Patio-Winnipeg1.png 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Forth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Forth bar, as customers say, is an absolutely beautiful bar with a marvellous patio. Truly, the place combines a coffee shop with a vivid hipster vibe on the main floor and a rooftop patio bar that overlooks Exchange District. In fact, the best time to visit the rooftop is right before the sunset hour. When golden sunlight touches downtown buildings, old and new alike, one no longer has a feeling that tomorrow is another workday; on the contrary, at the Forth rooftop bar, one feels like on a vacation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the food and drinks options, you can order such quick snacks as avocado toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, croissants, yogurt parfait and others, while the bar on the roof offers craft cocktails. As satisfied customers mentioned, you can tell the bartender about the flavours you like, and they will invent a cocktail just for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.forth.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.forth.ca/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cibo Waterfront Café</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cibo Waterfront offers a variety of Mediterranean-inspired foods like bruschetta, pizza, pasta and a selection of wines and beer. Customers confess that this restaurant is an enjoyable place for late-night food and drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while you might find quality pasta at many other places, the main attraction, in this case, is the location and the building itself. Like many other fashionable dining spots, Cibo locates in a former industrial building. (Pump and Screen House used to provide water coolant to Winnipeg’s Steam Heating Plant). The building still presents a high ceiling, massive windows, and brick walls: altogether, with a simple yet elegant interior, it creates a unique atmosphere. The patio has comfortably assembled tables and couches. At the moment, they, however, do not accept any reservation; instead, it is first-come, first-serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, across the road is the Mere Hotel. Thus, if you are a visitor in the city it might be a fine option for accommodation with a walking distance restaurant choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.cibowaterfrontcafe.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Browns Socialhouse Portage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers say Browns Socialhouse serves the best Caesar salad they have had in Winnipeg so far. Nevertheless, if you are not looking for the best salad in the city, but simply want a cozy patio with heaters, comfortable chairs, music, and city lights all around, this restaurant is worth checking out. Even though Browns Socialhouse belongs to a chain brand, according to many customers’ reviews it is one of the favourite places among locals. Some appreciate service; some enjoy a location that is right in the middle of downtown, and all of them, of course, agree that food is both tasty and comforting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu is enormous compared to other restaurants and offers a variety of cuisines. You can find sushi, soups, salads, fish and chips, burgers, pasta, famous bowls and tacos. And, to accompany all that food there is a broad menu of wines, beer, and cocktails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://brownssocialhouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">https://brownssocialhouse.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"835\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6917\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2.png 835w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-770x514.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/08/patio-Winnipeg2-500x334.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>SMITH</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SMITH restaurant is located at the Forks, the area so loved by both locals and tourists. It is an upscale, modern, yet casual space with so much thought put into interior design and menu. The whole atmosphere of the restaurant, which is conveniently located inside the Inn at the Forks hotel, is finished in a unique combination of slick lines of wooden furniture, comfortable seating and virtuously prepared and served food. As for the patio, this year SMITH restaurant offers a new pop-up space in front of the hotel facing the Oodena Circle and Johnston Terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu is based on simple, yet freshest ingredients, and celebration of lands and water of the country: the focus is on cooking from locally produced and seasonal products of Canada. You can find such dishes as steaks, salads, grilled vegetables, burgers and more. Additionally, to accompany the fresh taste of ingredients, order some wine from Okanagan valley or craft cocktails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://smithrestaurant.ca/\">https://smithrestaurant.ca/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Peasant Cookery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Peasant Cookery is another local restaurant that deserves attention and a visit at least once a season for no other reason but to celebrate summertime. As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere of the 20th century overwhelms you, and the feeling that you are in the middle of a historic drama is inevitable. The restaurant is located right in the heart of Exchange District, and monumental buildings around and pleasant atmosphere in the restaurant create a unique dining experience. According to many satisfied customers, Peasant Cookery is the choice number one for anniversary celebration: dishes are simple and delicious, and the atmosphere is sophisticated yet down to earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu offers dishes cooked from fresh, locally sourced ingredients along with wines, local beers and craft cocktails. There are such pleasures as escargots, mussels, charcuterie boards, salmon, tarte flambé and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell us about your favourite patio in downtown Winnipeg and enjoy your summer cocktail!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://peasantcookery.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">https://peasantcookery.ca/</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are certain activities we associate with summertime only.

We get lots of sunshine and there are plenty of things to do. Many people think of great summer adventures outside of our city, as we have wonderful parks and other outdoor spaces. But don’t be fooled. Downtown has its charms and attractions too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you are living in or visiting downtown Winnipeg on a fine summer’s day, where should you start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Forks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the obvious. The Forks is wonderful year-round. There is the fabulous indoor market. The Common now serves libations both indoors and out. You can pull up a Muskoka chair and sit around a fire in the evening, or you can walk along the riverfront. You can watch the boats go by, spy on the ducks and geese and even fish right off the Riverwalk. I’ve seen many a catfish pulled out of the water right by the docks. There are beautiful gardens and the Oodena to walk through. It takes an awful long time to get bored at the Forks, and it doesn’t cost you any money to wander around.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Forks-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6854\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-1024x576.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-770x433.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-293x165.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Forks.png 1329w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Parks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forks isn’t the only pretty outdoor space downtown. Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park is tiny but lovely. You will find it at the corner of Main St. and Assiniboine. There is a small remnant of the fort, comfortable and original seating, and a lightshow every evening. If you bring your furry friend, you can cross Assiniboine and enter downtown’s Bonnycastle Dog Park. It’s nice to know not every part of downtown is a concrete jungle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downtown Winnipeg Farmer’s Market</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for fresh produce? You don’t need to leave downtown. During the warm months, you can trek over to the Downtown Winnipeg Farmer’s Market. Its current home is in True North Square. You will find it open every Thursday from 10am to 2:30pm, with all sorts of fresh produce sold from local farmers. You can also find baked goods, jams, honeys, cheese, crafts and other fun stuff. It’s wonderful being able to shop in the open air.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Yoga-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6855\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-1024x682.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Yoga.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fitness in the Park</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you overindulge in the baked goods at the market, you might consider joining Fitness in the Park for one of their many sessions. They offer free lunch classes every weekday. They use multiple locations, so this is also a nice way to get to know downtown Winnipeg’s green spaces. Currently, Fitness uses the Legislative grounds, Memorial Park, and the Millennium Library grounds for classes. Their main focuses are yoga and Morfit. It’s nice to get a midday break from being cooped up indoors and it’s a great way to keep fit. To learn more about the program, visit the Downtown Winnipeg Biz site. (<a href=\"http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Exchange District</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the northeastern edge of downtown, The Exchange District beckons for visitors. You can sign up for one of their historic walking tours (<a href=\"http://www.exchangedistrict.org/historic-walking-tours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.exchangedistrict.org/historic-walking-tours/</a> ). Or you could just take yourself around. There are funky shops to visit and eateries aplenty, from poutine to fancy cuisine. Lose yourself on the winding streets and pretend you are visiting a city from a hundred years ago. The heritage buildings are delightful and a photographer’s dream. We are lucky that Winnipeg’s stalled economic progression from last century left us this beautiful legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Garden-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6856\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Garden.png 1296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gardens</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like flowers and pretty foliage? Who doesn’t? While you can see some lovely examples at the parks already mentioned, there are two other places downtown that are worth a visit. The Manitoba Legislature and surrounding buildings are lovely all year, but summer adds a pretty splash of colour. From the Leg, you can also walk down to the Riverwalk and enjoy the Assiniboine River.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the Leg, it’s a short walk to Dalnavert Museum on Carlton St. You may know it for its indoor tours of life in the 1800s, but the outdoor grounds are also worth a viewing. You can do a self-guided garden tour in the summertime. The gardens surround the house and are divided into six distinctive areas. Visit <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.friendsofdalnavert.ca</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Boat Tours</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you get sick of using your feet, you can head back to where you started, the Forks, for a river tour. Splash Dash is at it again this summer. You can book a ticket on their boats and cruise both the Assiniboine and Red, while learning a dash of history from your driver. Covid has changed their rules a little, but you can still book in with a group for a relaxing tour. Check them out at <a href=\"http://www.splashdash.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">www.splashdash.ca</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Material Future Summer Events</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we said seven, but let’s add an eighth reason to visit downtown — patios! Yep, downtown Winnipeg is chock full of them. Big ones, small ones, even rooftop ones. If you are looking for inspiration, check out the recent Patio Fest put on by Downtown Winnipeg Biz for location inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Patio-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6857\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1024x682.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1155x770.png 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-1400x933.png 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/07/Patio.png 1475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, while Covid still has many attractions closed, some will return later this summer and others will return next year. The Winnipeg Art Gallery, with its beautiful new Qaumajuq exhibit showcasing Inuit art, will likely be open by summer’s end, as will the Manitoba Museum. Once sporting events are back, it’s always a treat to take in a Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fish have an exceptional baseball park just across from the Forks. I don’t know about you, but I certainly miss stadium popcorn, hot dogs and drinks. Other events, like outdoor movies, might also return, making downtown an even more happening place. And if you live downtown, you don’t even need to worry about parking. That sounds rather ideal to me.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winnipeg in summer can be a glorious place.

I think it’s safe to say it’s not in most of ours. But it happens. Then suddenly, your life is in upheaval and your vision for the future needs to change. It’s stressful and kind of scary. And it sucks. But, it can also be an exciting opportunity to establish the new and improved, independent you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mondo checkbox on that to-do list is finding your new home. It’s a pretty daunting task. For most of us, being at home makes us feel comfortable and safe. If you don’t have that refuge to return to, or it’s full of reminders of your past life, well, it can make a tough time even harder. But it <em>is </em>possible, and even manageable. <em>You’ve got this.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that if I can do it, you can too. It won’t be easy, but you’ll be back on your feet in no time. Remember though, every situation is unique. Assess your circumstances and then tackle those hurdles as only you can!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you do anything else, you’ve got to answer this all important question:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s your budget?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A budget is <em>integral</em> to starting things off right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re going from living with a spouse and splitting the expenses to living on your own, you’re going to need to reassess your finances. Depending on your situation, this may drastically affect your standard of living (harsh, but true).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break down your monthly income and your current expenses. Which are non-negotiable? Which can be reduced? And when in doubt, round up! If you always count on socking away a little extra, the surplus will help to cover any unexpected expenses that crop up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a ballpark figure, about 30% of your monthly income is going toward rent. Depending on your earnings and your housing needs, that number might be even higher. In the quest for your new address, be sure to consider what utilities and amenities are included &#8211; a higher monthly payment might be worth it if it covers your electric bill and gym membership too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve run the numbers and you’re going to be hard pressed to make ends meet, <em>don’t panic</em>. There is social support in place for this situation you may qualify for. Those in Manitoba can find out more through the 2-1-1 phone line or website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know how much you’re prepared to spend, it’s time to hit the bricks (or the search engine).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6801\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-300x203.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-770x521.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-293x198.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1-500x338.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce1.jpg 1338w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding a place</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like with any important decision: take your time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another way of saying <strong>don’t take the first thing that comes along</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re eager to get out of this limbo and on with your life! But it’s worth it to look around and weigh your options (especially remembering some ‌places I considered &#8211; yikes!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do you want a place that fits your budget, you want something that fits your lifestyle. Somewhere you can reclaim that safe and comfortable environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short term, I recommend renting as opposed to buying for two main reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>&nbsp; &#8211; Right now your future is uncertain. A lease gives you the option to adjust your plans as circumstances evolve. Plus, it’s easier to find something that fits your budget.</li><li><strong>Convenience &#8211; </strong>You have enough to deal with without worrying about replacing appliances or building and yard maintenance! Instead, you can plunk yourself in a central location with easy access to whatever amenities you need.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>My downtown apartment was the perfect haven, with easy access to transit, restaurants, parks and entertainment. It had everything I needed to let me hunker down and put myself back together again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re searching the streets for vacancy signs, try not to worry about landing something&nbsp; before the month closes. If possible, shack up with a friend or even your Mom for a few weeks while you get your house in order (literally and figuratively). This gets you out of your old place into a transitory state. You’ll be more motivated to find a pad of your own <em>and</em> it gets you out of your old place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can check into short-term leases. If you need a place to recoup for a month or two before you sign a long-term lease, these can provide temporary asylum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The local Rental Guide, classifieds, internet searches and prowling the pavement are all great ways to get a beat on lucrative places for rent. Check them out and see what your options are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your new home is where you’re going to begin the next chapter of your life, it’s okay to take a bit of time to figure out something that fits you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ok, so you’ve found a place. Now what?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Out with the old in with the you!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things about divorce? Getting to choose your own aesthetic. Now’s your chance to design your space in a way that reflects <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purge the items that don’t fit anymore &#8211; both emotionally and physically. Throw the wedding pictures in storage, and swap that too big, memory ridden furniture for something that fits your space and your style. Whether you’re trawling department stores or thrift shops, it’s refreshing to pick out some new pieces you love.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Plan for Plants!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>People are happier with plants around. It’s almost like we do better with other living things nearby! (We do, that’s science.) I don’t pretend to understand <em>why </em>exactly having plants makes you feel better, but they reduce stress and improve your mood just by being there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not a plant person, you have options. Have you considered a spider plant? Even I managed not to kill that. Or, check out these out articles to find your fit:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/finding-your-houseplant-match/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Finding your houseplant match</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/which-plants-grow-best-in-your-apartment-making-your-apartment-greener/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">-Make your apartment greener</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Potentially pets</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6802\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-770x518.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-293x197.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1-500x336.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pets1.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s already you and your furry friend against the world, you’re set. But if not, you may want to take up cat-sitting, because like plants, we’re happier with animals around. You might even look into fostering or adopting a pet of your own!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caring for and having the company of animals can be rewarding and fulfilling. But think carefully before adopting a pet &#8211; it’s a big commitment. If your life is already in turmoil, heaping more responsibility onto your plate may not be the best idea. It adds extra complexity such as ensuring your new abode is pet friendly, and paying additional damage deposits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, having an animal around is super therapeutic because, well, they’re often cuddly and adorable. Plus the previously mentioned scientifically backed benefits of other living things! You’ve got options though &#8211; there are lots of programs in need of good foster homes for animals while they wait for adoption, or you can volunteer your time at the shelters themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, definitely crash your friend’s next trip to the dog park!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Get to know your neighbourhood</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re in a new place with all kinds of new things to discover! It can be a little intimidating, and you may still be mourning the loss of your favorite coffee shop, but getting out and about in your neighbourhood has multiple benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, it’s important that you actually get up and leave your place occasionally, even if you don’t want to. Being outside is <em>another </em>of those scientifically backed well-being things. Plus, how else are you going to find the local restaurant with the best patio?? (Besides on the internet &#8211; you need to go check it out!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting familiar with your new surroundings is a <em>huge</em> step toward quelling that out-of-place feeling. You’ll start recognizing the local baristas and it will ‌become more and more like home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remember: Everything is going to be OK</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6803\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/Divorce2-1-500x375.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It might take a while, but over time things will begin to feel normal again. In the meantime, it’s okay <em>not </em>to be okay. Lean on your friends and family, talk to a therapist, dispose of that pair of your ex’s underwear you found, preferably in a needlessly spectacular and ruthless fashion. Do what you need to do to get through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divorce is cruddy, but it’s also the start of something new. Things won’t ever be the same, but there are plenty of reasons you don’t want them to be. By taking the time to prepare and find a place that provides what you need, you’ll have a new home base and foundation off which to launch. Having the comfort of a home that embodies <em>you</em> will provide the safety and structure you need to heal and start the next leg of your journey.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, divorce wasn’t exactly in your life plan.

Goodbye winter jackets and hello spring dresses. Who doesn’t love the smell of freshly cut grass in the air? The sight of colorful flowers finally popping up in the soil?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is one of the most awaited seasons for most of us in Winnipeg. Winters are too cold and summers can sometimes be too hot. With limited mobility though, some of us might not feel as excited to greet the season as others normally do. But have no fear! There is still a lot to do in the city! And downtown has some attractive places to offer!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, look at that sun shining. And a quick check at the weather app confirms it is 20 degrees. A warm day means it’s the perfect time to try out some new ice cream flavors. <a href=\"https://www.feteicecreamcoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fête on Assiniboine Avenue</a> is a cute little ice cream shop that boasts of not only great ice cream, but amazing coffee, cakes and waffle crisps (I didn’t know this was a thing, but it is! And this taste delicious with ice cream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus? You can take a stroll in the park next door as you enjoy your favorite flavor of ice cream. Bonnycastle Park also has a little dog park in the vicinity, so it’s a great spot to go to for you and your furry pal to enjoy a sweet treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png\" alt=\"Dog Running in the field\" class=\"wp-image-6739\" width=\"761\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220.png 655w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-matthias-zomer-422220-293x165.png 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another favorite ice cream spot is <a href=\"https://chaebanicecream.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chaeban on Osbsorne</a>. They have some amazing flavors with very wholesome ingredients. I kid you not, I could taste real mint leaves in their mint ice cream. Their outdoor sitting area offers the perfect opportunity to enjoy a relaxed evening outdoors just enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown while having a heavenly treat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sough after landmark to enjoy the season is the Forks Market. You can pop inside the market to check out stores that offer unique handmade items or simply roam around the Commons to grab a drink and enjoy the sun. The area also offers a scenic view and a track along the river where you can bike or jog to soak up some sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if you enjoy history there are some great monuments to see. And if you’re more into modern art, they’ve recently set up the ‘Forever Bicycles’ monument along with other art pieces to view. If you have little kids to entertain alongside, they have great play structures and a splash pad to cool off after all the walking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking alongside the Riverwalk at <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Forks </a>can take you to another landmark in downtown, the Legislative Building. With its extensive gardens and fountain, you can not only get a scenic view to enjoy a cup of coffee, but also admire the structure of the Legislative Building itself with the golden boy shining in all his glory. It makes for a lovely backdrop for some great pictures, especially during sunset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg also offers an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visit the Exchange District</a>, very close to the intersection of Portage and Main, one of the most popular intersections in all of Canada. The Exchange District has heritage buildings so if you’re looking for a sneak peek into the city’s past, it’s the perfect twenty blocks for a stroll. You can expect to see restaurants, theatres and the Old Market Square with its quaint backdrop. &nbsp;Each structure has a story to tell, if we only have the time to listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not a history or art buff like me, and prefer instead to be surrounded by nature, maybe listening to some water flowing or birds chirping then I have a great spot for you. But where will you find a spot like that in downtown amidst all the hustle and bustle of Main Street? Not too far I promise. In fact, it’s in our very own downtown.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-14 wp-block-gallery-13 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6741\" data-full-url=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png\" data-link=\"https://livingat300main.ca/?attachment_id=6741\" class=\"wp-image-6741\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-770x513.png 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-370x247.png 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-293x195.png 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/06/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683974.png 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the idea of sitting on a picnic blanket and sipping some lemonade sounds appealing to you then look no further, and I mean literally! I recently discovered this cute little park called Happyland Park right here in downtown. It has an amazing view of the river, rolling green hills and a great play area for the kids. There are sitting areas made if you aren’t the picnic blanket sort and the open green space is a real treat for the eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also check out <a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/information/discovering-ufg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Upper Fort Garry Heritage Provincial Park on Main Street</a>. It not only has light and sound shows but sometimes, you might be able to spot yoga enthusiasts practicing. Feel free to join in if you’re looking for an opportunity to unwind!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring in Winnipeg is like a finicky hotel guest, looking for a reason to check out. So let’s try to make the most out of this season. Use it to explore downtown, take long walks, eat lots of ice cream and smell that fresh grass every chance you get!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liked the article? <a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/its-ice-cream-time-a-guide-to-downtown-winnipeg-ice-cream-shops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here and check our definitive guide to Ice Cream shops in Downtown!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finally!

Plus, we’ve got breakfast and lunch to contend with as well, now that we’re spending more time at home than ever.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are still plenty of takeout and delivery options in Winnipeg, home cooking is less expensive and &#8211; usually &#8211; a healthier choice (plus, the less contact with other people the better!). But&nbsp;<em>what are you making??</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing for three meals a day, seven days a week &#8211; plus snacks! Don’t forget the snacks! &#8211;&nbsp; can be pretty daunting, but meal planning isn’t about picking out 12 new recipes you’ve never tried before and forcing them into your week. It’s about forming your food schedule around your lifestyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think that meal planning is only for busy soccer moms, but regardless of whether you’ve got a family at home or it’s just you and your<em>&nbsp;tchotchkes</em>, a little prep can save you time, money, and more importantly, the anguish of having to choose what’s for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do a lot of cooking to support my eating habit and I’ve picked up a few strategies over the years. Here are my tips for creating a manageable meal plan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/First-picC-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Woman cooking dinner\" class=\"wp-image-6623\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/First-picC.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>1 &#8211; <strong>Plan around your schedule.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re thinking about meals for the upcoming week, consider what else you’ve got going on and how they will affect your time and energy for food prep.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slotting in a crock-pot recipe if you’ll be at the (home) gym late, or you’re planning that Zoom cocktail get-together with your friends, lets you quickly throw together a completed meal.&nbsp;Or, when the whole evening is wide open, that’s the perfect opportunity for something more elaborate you’ve been wanting to try!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to keep in mind (as if we could forget) &#8211; Mondays are hard. Whatever day your Monday actually is, plan for something delicious and relatively easy (think pasta night with salad for lunch). A quick win at the beginning of your week starts you off on the right foot and makes the rest of the week seem easier!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Basic ingredients\" class=\"wp-image-6625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-1400x934.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/3Build-your-basics-1-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2 &#8211; <strong>Consider what’s in your refrigerator.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If those bell peppers are on their last legs or your milk is about to expire, pick recipes that will use them up!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try writing a master ingredient list for everything you want to make in the coming week. Before you go to the store, go through your fridge, freezer, cupboards, secret food stash in the ceiling and mark off all the things you already have &#8211; Ta-da! Whatever is left is your grocery list!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3 &#8211; <strong>Build your basics.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-stocked pantry is the key to successful home cooking. These are your building blocks for many recipes and are enough on their own to throw together a Plan B meal in a pinch. At minimum, I’m talking about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Salt &amp; pepper&nbsp;</li><li>Olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>Soup stock (chicken or veggie are the most versatile),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Rice&nbsp;</li><li>Pasta&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;vinegar&nbsp; (mine is balsamic but if you’re only going to pick one, white wine vinegar is my recommendation&nbsp; &#8211; it’s mild, gives the acidity you want and gives a little wine-y&nbsp;flavor&nbsp;to your recipes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>And don’t forget a sweetener &#8211; honey, agave or even maple syrup!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other good things to keep around are: garlic, ginger, onions, beans (canned for spontaneous beans or dried if you’re really planning ahead), canned tomatoes and some canned soups. There are so many things you can do with a can of mushroom soup! I’ll share my recipe for mushroom “Alfredo” sauce below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you get an idea of what your go-to recipes take, you’ll know what else you want to keep on hand. You probably want a selection of your&nbsp;cherished&nbsp;condiments and sauces &#8211; ever since I discovered <em>Hoisin</em> sauce, there is never not some in my fridge!&nbsp;And it never hurts to keep an emergency box of KD around,&nbsp;<em>just&nbsp;</em>in case!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"820\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg\" alt=\"Food portioned to be frozen\" class=\"wp-image-6626\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-300x240.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-770x616.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-293x234.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers-500x400.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/4Anticipate-leftovers.jpg 1207w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4 &#8211; <strong>Anticipate leftovers.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love leftovers! Not only do I get more of the delicious things I already made, but I also get to skip cooking something else. If I make up a big batch of meatballs, that’s three or four meals worth of protein that I can either eat with leftover rice, throw in with other ingredients, or if I don’t want to eat the same thing all week, freeze for later.&nbsp; Which reminds me of&#8230;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5 &#8211; <strong>Batch cook meals to freeze (so when you don’t want to cook, you don’t have to!).&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re cooking up big meals, why not go the extra kilometer and make some things that are freezer friendly? This can be leftovers (if your recipe freezes well), a batch of freezer burritos (don’t worry, I’ve got a recipe for you) or breakfast muffins (regular muffins, or egg “muffins”, or even donut muffins. I couldn’t choose my&nbsp;favorite, but there are many recipes online).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part &#8211; if you spend a little time creating these freezer meals, you have several options to grab, nuke, and go for those days when you don’t have the time or energy to get in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Man holding plate of tacos\" class=\"wp-image-6627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-1400x935.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/6Try-a-theme-day.jpg 2022w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>6 &#8211; <strong>Try a Theme Day!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For an easy jumping off point in your meal planning, slot in a Theme Day (the term for this is actually Meal Templates, but that is not as fun as a Theme Day).&nbsp;We always think of Taco Tuesday, but you could do Mexican Monday or Curry Thursday. Your Theme can be whatever you like &#8211; it doesn’t even have to start with the same letter as the day! Pick a couple of categories you like and plan on them once a week. Fun!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of focal point is helpful when you’re meal planning. You’re basically narrowing down the field from&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>the recipes to a specific category of recipes to choose from. If you know that you’re having pasta on Friday you only need to decide whether you’re making that decadent carbonara or a lasagna that could feed you through the weekend (or freezes really well).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7- <strong>Rely on your tried-and-true recipes.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our go-to meals, the ones we keep coming back to again and again. Well, they’re&nbsp;popular&nbsp;for a reason! It’s not necessary to get a roster of brand-new recipes every week. On nights when you’re busy with other things or you just want something easy or familiar, rely on those recipes that you know will not fail you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My current easy, throw-together meal is a cucumber and tomato salad (and yes, you can have this recipe too). It’s super versatile and as simple as chopping up some veg, throwing that into a bowl and eating!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8 &#8211; <strong>Try new things.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the internet, we no longer need to rely on our mothers’ hand-me-down cookbook for recipes (though do keep that close by). It’s easy to search for a recipe for almost anything and find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even websites where you plug in the ingredients you want to use, and it will return a list of options for you! (Reverse lookup for recipes? Yes, please!). Personally, I’m a big fan of All Recipes where people share their own recipes and others can review them. You can see pictures, read about how it turned out, and what you might want to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One sneaky little trick (a&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;of my mother’s) is to regularly patrol the send-you-meal-ingredients-in-a-box service websites. There is often a cache of recipes that rotates with what they’re currently offering. You can snag those tasty recipes and then buy your own ingredients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9Prep-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Chopped vegetables on the board\" class=\"wp-image-6628\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/9Prep.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>9 &#8211; <strong>Prep ingredients in advance.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of knowing what you’ll be making is figuring out what ingredients you need ahead of time. This makes it easy to chop up a bunch of vegetables whenever you have a spare 10 minutes, and have them ready to go. If you can’t imagine where you’d get a spare 10 minutes, set aside a dedicated half hour at some point in the week instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all your onions, peppers and garlic are already chopped, you can throw them straight into the pan without worrying about the prep work. Trust me, you’ll thank your past self for your forethought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So&#8230;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meal planning seems like a lot of work. And don’t get me wrong, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;still work. But the amount of time you put into it easily pays itself back and then some when you no longer need to waffle (mmm… waffles) over what you are going to make for breakfast, lunch and dinner each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking is creative &#8211; have fun with it! I like to use versatile recipes that can be catered to my own tastes. Don’t be afraid to experiment &#8211; adjust the seasonings to your preference. If you hate bell peppers but love carrots, swap them out. Not all your experiments will turn out to be amazing, but some of them will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve got a few recipes to get you started. These are my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;versions of these recipes, and I can tell you that&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;love them, but make your own adjustments as you see fit. Have fun!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Mushroom Alfredo\" class=\"wp-image-6629\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/Mushroom-alfredo.jpg 1524w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Mushroom “Alfredo” &#8211;&nbsp; 4 servings</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly traditional, but tasty and with less fat than a true Alfredo&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2 teaspoons olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>1 small yellow onion, chopped&nbsp;</li><li>2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped (this is being conservative, but you measure garlic with your heart)&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)&nbsp;</li><li>1 can of condensed mushroom soup&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup (about 1 soup can full) half &amp; half cream&nbsp;</li><li>½ cup grated parmesan cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Fettuccine noodles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Parsley&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Directions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet.

The rest of my apartment&nbsp;was light on&nbsp;décor and&nbsp;heavy on&nbsp;notebooks and papers. However,&nbsp;a&nbsp;year of dreaming&nbsp;about decorating&nbsp;as soon as my bank account would&nbsp;allow,&nbsp;made me focus on&nbsp;identifying the&nbsp;colours, shapes and styles&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wanted around&nbsp;me. That research, inspiration boards and constant visits to vintage shops&nbsp;helped me form a clear picture&nbsp;of what pieces I needed. I focused on mid-century inspired furniture, minimal artwork, and a&nbsp;palette of grey, blue and yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;surrounded by millions of choices. Online shopping&nbsp;means we can order&nbsp;a coffee table with two clicks.&nbsp;Or we can drive to the nearest big-box store and pick out a couch on the spot. But even with&nbsp;a plethora of choices,&nbsp;it can be hard to find just the right item to make your space feel complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mistake of not&nbsp;doing your research&nbsp;means you’re not&nbsp;defining&nbsp;your&nbsp;style and&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;colour palette. Without a precise idea&nbsp;of what you’re looking for,&nbsp;shopping trips&nbsp;quickly spiral into&nbsp;confusion and irritation.&nbsp;On the other hand, a clear picture of what you want&nbsp;will make&nbsp;every&nbsp;store visit&nbsp;easier—even if it takes you a while to find what you’re looking for.&nbsp;Instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;making&nbsp;impulsive purchases as soon as you move in,&nbsp;focus on studying the space, picking&nbsp;your&nbsp;favourite colours, planning the amount of furniture, and imagining&nbsp;the final look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6522\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1024x902.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-300x264.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-770x678.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1536x1353.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-293x258.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-1400x1233.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research-500x441.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-research.jpg 1832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick research tips</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use Pinterest to create virtual inspiration boards and save your ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Browse&nbsp;interior design magazines like Vogue Living, ELLE Decoration, House &amp; Garden,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Style at Home&nbsp;(check the library for free copies, but no cutting out photos!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Take your inspiration from cinematography!&nbsp;Pick the era or style you want to reflect in your place and gather ideas from movies&nbsp;set in&nbsp;that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A&nbsp;stroll&nbsp;through the park, evening at the lake,&nbsp;or walk in the snow&nbsp;can not only&nbsp;give you&nbsp;ideas,&nbsp;but&nbsp;also be a great photography inspiration for DIY décor!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 2:&nbsp;Buying everything at once&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband is a wise man: he held&nbsp;my hand&nbsp;to keep it away from my&nbsp;credit card every time I was close to&nbsp;making an&nbsp;impulsive&nbsp;purchase. He&nbsp;would ask, “Would this item&nbsp;bring&nbsp;you&nbsp;the same joy&nbsp;a few years from now?”&nbsp;When I did eventually make purchases,&nbsp;I found myself fully satisfied with&nbsp;my choices.&nbsp;Plus,&nbsp;I really enjoyed&nbsp;looking around&nbsp;and&nbsp;taking&nbsp;the time to explore&nbsp;unknown&nbsp;shops&nbsp;to finally find that one unique item.&nbsp;(I’m&nbsp;also&nbsp;happy with my&nbsp;husband for&nbsp;talking me out of buying things spontaneously&nbsp;without&nbsp;a second thought!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-buy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6521\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-buy.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furniture, especially essential pieces we use every day, is not&nbsp;something we can&nbsp;easily&nbsp;donate&nbsp;whenever you want to try something new. A dining table is not a sweater that&nbsp;can&nbsp;be worn twice and then passed&nbsp;on&nbsp;to someone else.&nbsp;The furniture we bring into our homes is usually with us a long time, so we should&nbsp;surround ourselves with&nbsp;things&nbsp;we genuinely enjoy looking at and using day after day.&nbsp;The consumer mentality is also changing. Minimalism and mindful purchasing&nbsp;are&nbsp;more than just trendy; they’re&nbsp;a helpful way to create less clutter and&nbsp;do less harm to the&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve done the hard work of defining your design concept and choosing colours,&nbsp;the&nbsp;next&nbsp;mistake to avoid would be buying it all at once. There is no worse feeling than the regret of the&nbsp;poor&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;you no longer like after just a few months.&nbsp;You walk around that no-longer-beautiful&nbsp;coffee table, blaming yourself&nbsp;for not searching longer because&nbsp;just yesterday&nbsp;you saw&nbsp;the coffee table of your dreams—too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hunt is the most exciting part of interior design!&nbsp;Sorting through&nbsp;local flea markets,&nbsp;exploring furniture stores&nbsp;other than The&nbsp;Brick and Ikea, looking for artisan-made pieces,&nbsp;not stopping until you’ve found the perfect piece… It’s fun and satisfying and will pay off for years to come!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mistake 3: </strong><strong>Choosing</strong><strong>&nbsp;only trendy pieces</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trends surround us for&nbsp;specific reasons. Companies follow fashion trends to sell more. People follow them to stay&nbsp;fashionable&nbsp;and&nbsp;project a certain image.&nbsp;Not every trend&nbsp;is&nbsp;worth following, though. Many trends won’t reflect&nbsp;your&nbsp;personal taste, and&nbsp;some trends don’t last very long.&nbsp;The same way leather leggings&nbsp;won’t always be popular,&nbsp;distinctly uncomfortable furniture trends will fade after a few seasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember&nbsp;the year of the&nbsp;ubiquitous obsession with golden pineapples.&nbsp;Pineapples were everywhere:&nbsp;on pillows, candles, cups, and even on bigger pieces of furniture.&nbsp;Pineapples were all over&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;on every shelf and every t-shirt. However, the trend faded rapidly&nbsp;because&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;real meaning behind it. (Don’t&nbsp;get me wrong: pineapple is delicious!). The&nbsp;poor&nbsp;pineapple&nbsp;is a great example of&nbsp;those trends that&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;becomes monotonous and gets thrown away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"974\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6520\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-974x1024.jpg 974w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-285x300.jpg 285w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-770x810.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1460x1536.jpg 1460w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-293x308.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-1400x1473.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple-500x526.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-pineapple.jpg 1755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, you’ll find a lot more&nbsp;pleasure in simple lines, quality materials, and classic designs. Trends&nbsp;can be fun to play with when adjusted for your&nbsp;personal style,&nbsp;but they’re better suited to&nbsp;small pieces such as&nbsp;pictures, candles, cups,&nbsp;and pillows. Those pieces are&nbsp;easier&nbsp;to replace when you’re&nbsp;tired of the trend or want to refresh it for another season. When searching&nbsp;for&nbsp;basic, important&nbsp;pieces of furniture, stay closer to minimal design and timeless forms&nbsp;to avoid long-term regret.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake 4: Picking&nbsp;the cheapest pieces&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, a&nbsp;carefully thought-out&nbsp;budget&nbsp;will save you&nbsp;money and allow you to purchase higher-quality pieces. Cheap, mass-produced&nbsp;furniture&nbsp;is like&nbsp;fast-fashion clothing.&nbsp;Cheap garments,&nbsp;and&nbsp;cheap furniture, are not made&nbsp;to last long. Brands&nbsp;hope for your return after the chair&nbsp;breaks in a year or two or&nbsp;the&nbsp;jeans rip after six months.&nbsp;They&nbsp;give up&nbsp;quality&nbsp;in favour of the&nbsp;cheapest-possible materials&nbsp;in mass production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until&nbsp;consumer habits change, cheap furniture and poor-quality clothing will&nbsp;stick around. As soon as we, as consumers, understand that higher-quality wood and fabric require more money, and better-made pieces require more time and effort,&nbsp;we can see the value in buying quality.&nbsp;Quality furniture,&nbsp;made to last,&nbsp;might&nbsp;seem more expensive than mass-produced housewares. But&nbsp;by&nbsp;buying a better-quality piece, you’re&nbsp;investing&nbsp;in the number of years&nbsp;the item will last without needing repair or replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6519\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2021/04/decoration-cheap-buy-500x333.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your&nbsp;couch wears out after a year of sitting on it, you&nbsp;might buy another&nbsp;low-quality one.

As the introvertiest of introverts, spending time at home is something I relish, but if you’re the type who likes to be on the go, you probably feel like you’re grounded and it </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">wasn’t even your fault</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">! Lucky for you, being sent to my room was always my punishment of choice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you’re stuck at home, here is my guide on how to cope in confinement:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 1: Take a deep breath</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The first thing to remember is that you’re at home, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">so </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">relax! Easier said than done, I know. When you have places to go and people to see, you’re usually on a clearly</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8211;</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">defined schedule. Since you’re </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">staying </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">home </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">right </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">now, take a deep breath and slow down: sleep in longer than usual, stay up late watching that critically</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8211;</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">acclaimed movie, prepare that delicious but oh-so-time-consuming recipe. Whatever it is, take your time.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Which brings me to Step 2. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Appreciate the little things</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Reacquaint yourself with how your favourite chair is comfortable in just the right way and luxuriate in the smell of your coffee. Sometimes when we’re surrounded by the same things every day, we </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">can’t help but </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">take them for granted</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Take </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a moment to reflect on life’s little joys and you’ll be happier for it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 3: Create structure</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To keep time from mushing together, it’s crucial to maintain at least some semblance of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">routine. It’s easy to get caught up in the relaxing we talked about, so I recommend you </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">still </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">get out of bed before a certain time in the morning, change your clothes (you can still wear pyjamas, just different pyjamas!), and aim to eat your meals and wind down for the night around the same time each day.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6295\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"How to Cope in Confinement During Social Distancing, covid-19. self isolation, self quarantine, social distancing, staying home, coronavirus, working from home, non-essential worker\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2020/04/man-wearing-black-crew-neck-shirt-and-black-jeans-3201765-2.jpg 1921w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now for the hard one:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Set goals</h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I often make lists of the things I’m looking to accomplish over the next </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">X</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> amount of time. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">My goals can</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be anything from </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">do the laundry</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">”</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">conquer the world</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">”</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (though unless you plan on conquering the world from your living room, maybe save that one for later.) </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:331}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keeping a to-do list sounds tedious, but think of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">it as a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">really responsible advent calendar</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">…where </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">you don’t get any chocolate and the days don’t matter</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

I moved into my first apartment as a teenager with my parents to save money, but there were many reasons why I stuck with apartments for so long.</p>\n<h3>Location, location, location</h3>\n<p>I’ve lived in multiple cities and provinces, and my biggest reason for sticking with apartment living was always location and the convenience it brought. I’m not a driver, so I like to be in or near downtown areas where buses are plentiful and I can walk to lots of places. I spent years being able to walk to work in less than 20 minutes, and I loved it. Walking is cheap, lets you avoid rush-hour frustration, and is an easy way to get exercise outdoors. (And yes, I still walked to work in Winnipeg winters. The trick is bundling up properly, and I’ll take that over +30℃ weather any day.)</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5d5WBZSPDD\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/\">Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/embed/#?secret=5d5WBZSPDD\" data-secret=\"5d5WBZSPDD\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>It was also nice to be able to walk to the grocery store, coffee shops, and restaurants. Going to a concert downtown? No problem. I strolled right past the line-ups of cars trying to leave the venue. I was often home before most cars had been able to move two blocks. And when I lived in Osborne Village, I had several friends who lived in the neighbourhood, so get-togethers were a cinch.</p>\n<h3>Not handy? No problem</h3>\n<p>Another thing I loved about apartment living was not worrying about upkeep. I am the opposite of handy, so it helped that the most I ever had to do was reset a breaker. If something broke, such as the air conditioner or stove, I didn’t have to fix it or pay to replace it. I also never had to cut grass or shovel snow. I truly miss my shoveling-free days.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"k2InmGbGll\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you/\">Rent vs Buy: Which is Right For You?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you/embed/#?secret=k2InmGbGll\" data-secret=\"k2InmGbGll\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Rent vs Buy: Which is Right For You?&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Community atmosphere</h3>\n<p>I also liked the safety and sense of community I felt in an apartment building. I didn’t always know my neighbours, but sometimes I made friends and it was nice to have people to say “hello” to on my way in or out. Being a single woman for many of those years, I always felt safer in a secure building with neighbours within earshot. Being alone at night in a house (particularly if it was a large house) always brought out the worst in my imagination.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"56Cpvm1R18\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/new-to-networking-start-with-your-neighbours/\">New to Networking?

I never had to worry about selling a house or what the market was like when it came time to move. I just gave my necessary notice and was off.</p>\n<p>I’ve always liked having a smaller place, too. (Even my house is small.) I like not having to furnish lots of rooms, and more importantly, I hate having to clean a big place. I could clean any of my apartments in less than an hour, so I didn’t waste my precious time on dreaded housework.</p>\n<h3>The one downside</h3>\n<p>My only beef about some of my apartments (always the older buildings) was when I had no control over the heat in winter. Those apartments were always too warm for my liking. In my last apartment, butter would half-melt on the counter because it was so hot! For this reason, I recommend looking for a relatively new building where you can control your own thermostat.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p><strong>Overall, there’s so much to like about apartment living that I’m surprised more people don’t try it. They’re missing out!

Shake to mix, and then add the Sal Suds and oil. Gently shake the bottle again to combine the ingredients.</p>\n<h3>Homemade Drain Cleaner</h3>\n<p>½ cup baking soda</p>\n<p>¼ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>Sprinkle baking soda down the clogged or smelly drain, then pour in the vinegar. Let the bubbling mixture sit for an hour or so, then pour boiling hot water down the drain to rinse. Depending on how clogged the drain is, you may need to repeat the process. If you clean your drain regularly, you’ll find that one dose will keep things clear.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Now let’s move on to the bathroom!</em></strong></p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5456\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade cleaning products, natural cleaning products, cleaning products winnipeg, winnipeg apartment living, downtown winnipeg living, apartment living\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/07/daiga-ellaby-uooMllXe6gE-unsplash.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Tub and Tile Cleaner</h3>\n<p>12 ounces white vinegar</p>\n<p>12 ounces dish soap (I usually use Dawn)</p>\n<p>Heat vinegar in the microwave until hot and then pour into the spray bottle.

Add the vinegar and the baking soda to the toilet next (without stirring or scrubbing) and wait until the mixture stops bubbling. Scrub any tough stains, otherwise just flush and you’re done! The soda and the vinegar/baking-soda mixture will also help to keep the pipes clear of buildup.</p>\n<p><em><strong>But what about carpets or stinky smells that linger around your house?</strong></em></p>\n<h3>Homemade Air Freshener</h3>\n<p>15 drops pure essential oil (grapefruit and lavender are my favourite!)</p>\n<p>½ cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>½ cup water</p>\n<p>Combine ingredients in a spray bottle and shake. Spray liberally around your home to freshen things up!</p>\n<h3>Carpet Cleaner</h3>\n<p>1 cup white vinegar</p>\n<p>2 cups water 2 teaspoons salt 15 drops lavender essential oil or another clear, pure essential oil of choice</p>\n<p>Combine vinegar and water in a large spray bottle. Add in salt and lavender essential oil; close the cap and shake bottle. Spray on carpets where needed and allow carpets to air-dry.

Classes usually run Monday to Friday from 12 to 1 pm. Visit the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/events/fitnessinthepark/\">Downtown Biz website</a> for details and an up-to-date schedule. These classes are free; just bring your yoga mat!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbwpg.cmha.ca/events/free-yoga-and-meditation-tuesdays-and-thursdays-2019-06-25/\"><strong>Yoga and meditation with Cian</strong></a><br />\n930 Portage Avenue</p>\n<p>Every Tuesday from 6 to 7 pm, Cian—a trained yogi—hosts a free yoga and meditation session for Winnipeggers of all levels of experience. The event is first come, first serve with only 20 spots available, so show up early to grab a spot!</p>\n<p><strong><em>My recommendation</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you’re not a fan of group classes, or just want to get your yogi on solo, downtown Winnipeg has beautiful parks where you can lay out your mat. One of my favourite quiet places is <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/business/stephen-juba-park/\">Stephen Juba Park</a>, right waterfront in the Exchange district. If you are looking for a quieter yoga session, try going early in the morning.</p>\n<h3>Where can I find a few minutes of silence?</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re looking for a peaceful place to study or somewhere quiet to relax, downtown Winnipeg has got your back!</p>\n<p><strong>Millennium Library<br />\n</strong>251 Donald Street</p>\n<p>A library is the most obvious place to look when craving a bit of silence, but the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/branchpages/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library</a> stands out among Winnipeg’s libraries. Spread on each side of a massive staircase, the study area is a designated “quiet zone.” At any point in the day, you’ll find people working in complete silence. This area is also beautiful, with simple design that won’t distract you from your work and enormous windows that stand from floor to ceiling. Natural light fills the area and it’s a wonderful place to find a few moments of peace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/leg-lib/\"><strong>Legislative Library</strong></a><br />\n200 Vaughan Street</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BjgRSZElbTB/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Located just across from downtown landmark <a href=\"https://locations.thebay.com/en/hudsons-bay-winnipeg-downtown\">Hudson’s Bay</a>, this library doesn’t usually come up when asking your study buddies, “Where should we study today?” Less people = less noise!</p>\n<p><em><strong>My recommendations</strong></em></p>\n<p>When I need a moment to get away from the noise, I find myself walking along the Red River!

If you want to go study at a quiet coffee shop or go for a walk without car horns as your soundtrack, try going while most people are at their desks.</p>\n<p><em>You don’t have to run far to find a bit of zen.

Deciding to add a dog to your family is a big commitment, but the joy a canine companion brings can’t be beat. You’re probably wondering: <em>How do I choose the right dog for my apartment?</em> Is it a question of size? Activity level? Or something else? The answer may surprise you!</p>\n<p>But before we head off to explore how to choose the right dog, there is some inner soul searching that needs to happen. You need to be honest with yourself about your lifestyle and what motivates your choices. You must first “know thyself” in order to find a good match, so that’s where we’ll begin!</p>\n<h3>The soul-searching basics</h3>\n<p>Whether you are considering a move downtown or are already there, ask yourself a few lifestyle questions first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What prompted the move?</li>\n<li>What drew you to the downtown life? To apartment life?</li>\n<li>What stage of life are you in? Career building? Retired? Somewhere in between?</li>\n<li>Do you like to travel? And if so, how often?</li>\n<li>How active are you? Are you a runner, hiker, or couch potato?</li>\n<li>Why do you want a dog?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5002\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HIking-2-1024x739.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking with a dog, active lifestyle, apartment dog, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartment\" width=\"1024\" height=\"739\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-1024x739.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-770x556.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-500x361.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2-293x211.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/HIking-2.jpg 1052w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>There are no wrong answers. Rather, the intent is to identify which aspects of your life are the most important and then determine how Moe will fit in.</p>\n<p>Did I forget to mention that I’ve already named your future dog?</p>\n<p>As for how active you are, I am not going to say that as a runner, a Shih Tzu or other small dog is out of the question or that as a couch potato, you shouldn’t consider a lab mix or Standard Poodle. Not at all. While the journey to find the right dog begins with you, once Moe comes home, it’s no longer just about you. Every dog will have needs that must be met—especially when it comes to expending energy—otherwise you may find yourself in a very unhappy, unhealthy relationship.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwmcR-3gUty/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Talk with your family, friends and dog owners. Online, you can find countless articles and sites that might be useful on your quest, but here are four to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.winnipeghumanesociety.ca/adopt/before-you-adopt/are-you-ready-for-a-dog/\">Winnipeg Humane Society: “Are you ready for a dog?”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ckc.ca/en/Choosing-a-Dog\">Canadian Kennel Club: “Choosing a Dog”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dogtime.com/matchup\">DogTime’s Dog Matchup tool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hillspet.ca/en-ca/dog-care/behavior-appearance/choosing-the-best-dog-breed-personality\">Hills Pet Nutrition: “Dog Breed Personalities: Find the Right Match For You”</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now begins life with Moe.</p>\n<h3>A tired dog is a good dog</h3>\n<p>Pet store staff can give you recommendations on how to entertain Moe with everything from chews to toys. And if burning off energy at the dog park is in his future, a ball or frisbee might be worth considering. For running and hiking, a comfortable and well-sized harness is a good investment; you can even purchase a comfortable doggy seatbelt for road trips.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5000\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5000\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3366-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Dog in a car seat, dog seatbelt, dog harness, apartment dog, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/06/IMG_3366.jpg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winston, Pug, 1</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>And yes, a bed, for those moments when Moe has finally run out of steam.</p>\n<p>It’s not so much the size of the dog that matters when it comes to apartment living but its excitability, tendency to bark and ability to adapt to smaller spaces. Remember that you are living in a community, and Moe needs to walk the hallways, meet your neighbours, and take the elevator when he’s not lounging in your apartment.</p>\n<p>Invest some time in training Moe to be a great canine neighbour. Yes, there is work involved but, it is well worth it. Both you and Moe will be thankful for having done it.</p>\n<h3>Green spaces and dog-friendly parks</h3>\n<p>Winnipeg has many green spaces and trails within a short distance from the downtown core. From Waterfront Drive and <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> to <a href=\"https://www.assiniboinepark.ca/\">Assiniboine Park</a>, you and Moe have plenty of options to get out and explore!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F300MainWinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1477463672396161&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"510\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center>The city operates 11 off-leash dog parks, one of which is right downtown. Located at Assiniboine Avenue and Garry Street, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bonnycastle+Dog+Park/@49.88574,-97.136492,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x1e9e944aafdf46e2!8m2!3d49.88574!4d-97.136492\">Bonnycastle Dog Park</a> is a 1,200 square-meter space. It’s safely fenced in and features artificial turf, perfect for dog paws to run around on.

Visit the city of Winnipeg website for a <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/parksOpenSpace/OffLeashDogParks/default.stm\">list of all off-leash dog areas</a>.</p>\n<h3>There’s no love like the love of a dog</h3>\n<p>As a dog owner myself, much of what I’ve said comes from personal experience. I could probably write a book about life with my pets over the years. Brandy (since passed away), a Shih Tzu, explored the eastern states from the green mountains of Vermont to the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts in a pink stroller because she didn’t like to walk. Alice, our Standard Poodle and an aspiring writer, is busy putting together her own coffee table book of decorating accomplishments. Alice and I can often be found at the Charleswood dog park with Winnie, a Bearded Collie. Woof, woof!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Have any questions about living the apartment life with your furry friend?

However, this is one of my favourite cafés in downtown Winnipeg as they are always willing to adapt their dishes to meet your needs.

The best part? Everything on the <a href=\"http://affinitygarden.com/home.html\">menu</a> is meatless—and delicious!

You might scoff and think there’s no way you want to move around this frigid city without one, but not everyone has access to a vehicle. Others are also worried about the environmental damage cars do.</p>\n<p>As someone who doesn’t drive, I’ve spent all of my adult life trying to move around cities without a vehicle. And I promise you, you can do it. Let’s look at your options.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en\">Winnipeg Transit</a></h3>\n<p>You can ride the good ol’ bus to move around our city. The service isn’t great from some outlying suburban areas, but you can reach most everywhere by bus. And it’s easy to figure out, too. There’s a Winnipeg Transit app you can download onto your phone. You can also use the Winnipeg Transit <a href=\"https://m.winnipegtransit.com/navigo\">Navigo website</a>.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4648\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4648\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4648\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2416-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Transit, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-100x100.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-770x770.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-293x293.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-390x390.jpg 390w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-585x585.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-900x900.jpg 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-1400x1400.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4648\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Very Canadian</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>With either version, you enter your departing address, your destination, and the time you need to arrive or leave. Navigo will then show you all your options to get where you are going, including walking time and time between transfers. You can also monitor a particular stop if you want to see when buses will arrive. The app/website shows where buses are in real time by tracking the fleet with GPS. This takes the guesswork out of knowing when your bus will arrive, which is particularly helpful on nasty weather days. The city could do better with transit, and we need more rapid transit routes, but this is one way you can get around Winnipeg.</p>\n<p>If you need to get around downtown, you can hop aboard one of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit buses</a>. They take a couple of different routes through the downtown area. The best part? <strong>The Downtown Spirit is always free!</strong></p>\n<h3>Your Bike</h3>\n<p>If you want to stay in shape and avoid all carbon emissions, cycling might be the way to go. And yes, you can cycle here year-round. (At least if you’re the hardy type.) The advent of fat bike tires can help you with winter cycling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center></center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbiIIHEBsQ_/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbiIIHEBsQ_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Winnipeg, we never put our bikes away&#8230; we just let some air out of the tires and go about our day!! . . . #canon60D #donsaction #Winnipeg #exploremb #explorecanada #artofvisuals #visualsgang #royalsnappingartist #way2ill #gramslayers #cityscape #paradisecanada #TrailsManitoba #exploreeverything #onlyinthepeg #allthingswinnipeg #visualscollective #world_great #discoverearth #discoverglobe #imagesofcanada #tourcanada #paradisecanada #moodygrams #agameoftones #vscogram #visualambassadors #visualcreators #canadagram #winteriscoming</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshuaa_blade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Josh</a> (@joshuaa_blade) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-11-15T22:49:05+00:00\">Nov 15, 2017 at 2:49pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>While you can cycle all city streets in Winnipeg, not everyone loves sharing the road with larger, faster moving cars. The city does have a series of dedicated bike routes, including downtown bike lanes. If you aren’t sure where to find these, the city provides a number of <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/pedestriansCycling/maps/default.stm\">bike maps to help you plan your trip</a>.</p>\n<p>Biking is a great way to see Winnipeg, particularly many of our downtown parks and pretty spaces!</p>\n<h3>Your Feet</h3>\n<p>Another great way to get in your daily exercise and protect the environment is by simply using your feet to move you from point A to point B. I used to live in <a href=\"https://www.osbornevillage.com/\">Osborne Village</a> and walked to work downtown every day, even in -35 degree weather.</p>\n<p>You can’t walk everywhere, but consider walking for your shorter trips. You will need good shoes (or good winter boots with grip) to stay comfortable, but those are far cheaper than a car. Wearing a good base layer or snow pants with your coat, hat and mitts can keep you nice and toasty in the winter. You also generate a fair amount of body heat when you’re moving around. Just make sure you invest in good quality gear; the super-cheap stuff might leave you too cold or too sweaty under your coat.</p>\n<p>Walking is great for your health, as is spending time outdoors in general. It can be difficult to walk down sidewalks in winter before the plows come up, but you can use the street instead (in residential areas). Or, you could truly embrace our winters and pull out your snowshoes!</p>\n<p>Downtown is a great place to walk, particularly around <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/jubapark.shtml\">Stephen Juba Park</a>. You will find many pretty things to see as you promenade along the water. In the winter, you can walk on the Red or Assiniboine and see all of the delightful <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts near the Forks</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.tappcar.com/\">Tapp Car</a></h3>\n<p>There might be times when you need to get somewhere that isn’t easily accessible except by car. You can use our local taxi services, but I quite enjoy Tapp Car, Winnipeg’s answer to <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/ca/en/\">Uber</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/\">Lyft</a>. We have a few other rideshare services in the city, but I can only vouch for Tapp Car, which was the first player here.</p>\n<p>They have an easy-to-use app that shows how long it will take your car to get to you, and shows the car make, model, colour and license plate, along with your driver’s name. This is nice to know for safety reasons. The cars are always clean, and the drivers are generally friendly. You set up payment directly in the app, so you don’t have to fuss with cash or a debit machine when you arrive at your destination.

This can be a great way to save yourself money and cut commuting time, but there are also potential pitfalls!</p>\n<p>I’ve used a home office for my writing and editing business since 2010, so I’m here to help with some tips about working from home and maintaining your sanity.</p>\n<h3>Finding a space to work</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to decide is where in your home you want to work. This can be tricky when space is tight. My first home office was in my downtown apartment. I only had one bedroom, so I couldn’t convert it to office space. I did have a large living room, so I set up my desk and office equipment on one side of it.</p>\n<p>Ensure your spot isn’t too enticing to encroach on. For example, if you have to work in your living room, setting up your desk near the front door might not work out. Your workspace could become a tempting spot to dump your coat, mail or keys when you walk in the door. Try to avoid creating your workspace in a high-traffic area, lest it become a repository for personal junk.</p>\n<p>You also need to consider lighting for your workspace. This is especially important if you’re a creative type and are doing painting, sewing, etc., in your home. Look for a spot near a window for natural sunlight. It also feels good to be able to look up and see the world while you’re hard at work.</p>\n<p>Noise will be another factor when choosing where to work. Some of you may love background noise, such as the radio or other people talking and moving about. I hate it and don’t work well with noise, so I always look for a quiet spot.</p>\n<p>Finally, try to make your space enticing to you. In my current home, we have a second bedroom for my office—but I mostly use it for business storage. I prefer working in my open kitchen at my big wooden table. I like being able to see a lot of things when I look up. If I’m at my desk in my office, I see wall. I learned too late that I should have turned my desk facing into the room instead of putting it against the wall, flanked by two big bookcases, as I don’t like feeling hemmed in while working. The moral of the story is to ensure your workspace makes you happy before you nail a desk to the wall.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4172 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Downtown Apartments, Home office, Renting\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/vadim-sherbakov-277610-unsplash2-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>Having adequate storage for your business items can also be tough in a small space. You might need a big desk, filing cabinets or somewhere to keep your materials and paint. Having worked in many tight spaces, I love Ikea for their storage items because they are particularly skilled at offering goods meant for small spaces. You might have luck finding a smaller desk or storage items that can double as something else.</p>\n<p>I’ve always liked footstools that double as storage boxes. I can keep items hidden away and still have space to rest my weary feet at the end of the day. Shelving that hangs on walls is also helpful. It saves floor space and can provide a nice visual piece in your home if you load it up properly. Look for anywhere you can store things in or under to maximize your use of space.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself if you can store more items electronically, rather than needing filing cabinets for everything. You might also have items you use infrequently and can store offsite or in harder to reach places in your home. I’m prone to towering piles of papers and books, so I need to take more of my own advice.</p>\n<h3>Tax considerations</h3>\n<p>This is the un-fun stuff, but you still need to pay attention. If you work for yourself from home, you can use part of your home expenses, such as rent and hydro, as business write-offs. There is a caveat though: CRA says the space must be used exclusively for your business. If it doubles as personal use, no dice. When I was in my apartment, I couldn’t write off part of my rent because my office was smack in the middle of my living room, which I also used for personal reasons. If you only have one bedroom, you might be in this same bind. Talk to your accountant to see what you can do about making your space eligible for home office deductions.</p>\n<h3>The whole work-life balance thing</h3>\n<p>The other problem to watch out for is the temptation to be working, or thinking about working, all the time. When your home and office are the same place, it can be difficult to pull yourself out of work mode. You can be sitting on your couch watching your favourite show, and something on your desk will catch your eye and try to lure you back to work. This is another reason picking the right work spot is critical. You don’t always want your work to be staring you in the face!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4169 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Work from home, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/adult-from-above-hair-983818-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>You might need to set specific boundaries for work hours to keep you from working day and night. For example, you could choose not to work or answer the phone on weekends or past 6 pm. As you spend more time working at home, you will realize what your trouble spots are, so you can create a plan to overcome them.</p>\n<p>You could also face the opposite problem. When you should be working, your TV or the book you left lying out last night might try to lure you back to leisure. You might need to set specific hours and boundaries for play time and naps that don’t keep you from earning a living. (Reading is great, but starvation is bad!)</p>\n<p>If you’re an introvert like me, you might feel tempted to never leave your home because everything you need is right there. Don’t get sucked into this vortex. We all need to go out sometimes, even if it’s just for a walk by ourselves. Try to plan regular outings. Join a professional organization related to your work, a Toastmasters club, a book club or anything else that will get you out of the house and socializing on occasion. Being a complete hermit is never a good idea.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p>Working from home can be great. I love being able to sleep late and have a commute that’s about 10 steps long. I don’t have to get gussied up to go anywhere and I can decide what I want for lunch at lunch time. The dog and I can take a break and go for a stroll midday. I even have someone to talk to in person when my husband gets home from work. But that doesn’t mean working from home is a perfect solution.</p>\n<p>To set yourself up for success, create a good workspace and plan specific work and leisure times. Talking to others who work from home is also a great way to learn new tips and coping mechanisms, so try to cultivate relationships with other self-employed people. With a little careful planning, you can have a successful work-from-home life that brings you satisfaction!</p>\n<p><em>Do you work from home?

And with the housing market rising, everyone seems to have advice about this decision. Millennials who are moving to bigger cities feel the pressure to get into the market. They’re told that buying is the smart move, and renting is just throwing away money. But is it? I took a look at the numbers and found six reasons why renting for Millennials is sometimes the best option.</p>\n<h3>“You build equity when you buy a house”</h3>\n<p>This statement is<a href=\"https://affordanything.com/is-renting-better-than-buying-should-i-rent-or-buy/\"> frequently used as an argument against renting</a>. The tenant rents for years and the landlord makes a profit, when the tenant could be using that money to save for a down payment or paying off a mortgage. On a basic level this is true, but it overstates the idea of gaining <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> from owning a property. Most 30-year mortgages build very little equity over the first 20 years, and only start building equity in the last decade. Most of your mortgage payment in the first two-thirds of time that you own a property is going towards insurance, taxes, and the organization that gave you the mortgage. Unless you’re very sure you are going to live in this house for the next 30 years, you’ll build minimal equity.</p>\n<p>House values also tend to increase with inflation. There have been very few periods in the last 100 years when house prices have risen beyond inflation, and when they did, they eventually declined when the “bubble burst.” When a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_bubble.asp\">housing bubble</a> bursts, the market value of your home quickly declines—but your mortgage debt doesn’t. Unless you get lucky and buy the right property at the exact right time in the right location, the chance of your house value rising by significantly more than the rate of inflation is minimal.</p>\n<h3>Being tied to a place for an allotted time</h3>\n<p>Millennials are lucky to have started our careers at a time dominated by technology. Many people have the freedom to work remotely from their computer. This freedom does not mesh well with a mortgage payment, which only sees equity growth in its later years. The economy is changing, and Millennials tend to go back to school or switch careers more often than baby boomers, but there’s little incentive for us to tie ourselves down to a 30-year mortgage until we know we’ll be staying in one place for a long time. Renting allows Millennials the freedom to spend money on travel, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/petesaunders1/2017/01/12/where-educated-millennials-are-moving/#f706ec0d3ccc\">starting a business</a>, or paying off student debt, rather than having money tied down in a place where you aren’t sure you will want to live for the next three decades.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3672 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Millenials, renting, buying a house, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/thought-catalog-641073-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>There are better ways to grow your wealth</h3>\n<p>Not only are the gains of equity from buying a house in some ways overstated, but if investment is your goal, there are more profitable ways to go about it. Renting can save you a lot of money on your yearly spending, and that money can be used to invest in stocks, ETF’s, Index Mutual funds, RRSP’s and other investment strategies that have a higher overall gain. As mentioned above, house prices tend to increase alongside inflation. Adjusting for that, a house in 1897 cost the same as a house in 1997. As for investing, The Financial Planning Standards Council <a href=\"https://www.tangerine.ca/forwardthinking/investing/what-is-a-realistic-rate-of-return-on-an-investment-portfolio\">states that</a>, “Return assumptions for a balanced portfolio range from 4.55%…to 6.05%.” Therefore, investing in stocks and bonds with the cash you’ve saved from renting is a more profitable option. The money you gain over years can be used to buy a home in a city that you know you’ll stay in.</p>\n<h3>Peace of mind</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/reasons-renting-is-better-than-buying.aspx\">lack of stress about maintenance or repair fees is a major perk of renting</a> as well, as the landlord or building manager responsible for these. This removes a major source of worry from your life as a renter, since you don’t have to think about replacing the furnace or the pipes if they break or hiring someone to check problems in your house. I know many homeowners who are frustrated with the amount of work they have to do just to maintain their living space. Renovations and repairs can be a huge drain, both financially and of your time. Renting allows you to spend your free time enjoying your home, not just keeping it in order.</p>\n<p>Another way renting removes stress is that you don’t have to worry about fluctuating markets and property taxes. <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/cca/rtb/rentincreaseguideline/calculate.html\">In Manitoba, the most rent can increase is 1% and 3% each year (with some exceptions)</a>, which many renters can manage. Property taxes, on the other hand, can rise by more, and the value of your home can swing wildly without you having any ability to budget for it. Knowing how much you are paying at the beginning of every month is a big stress reliever for Millennials, who often freelance and work jobs that are more fluid.</p>\n<h3>Amenities and extras</h3>\n<p>Not a lot of people have a pool, a gym, a party room, or a tennis court in their house. But with a lot of newer condominiums, these are built in! These facilities are right in the building and make exercise and social gatherings easy and affordable, which is important in our society where we all seem to be so busy. These amenities would normally require Millennials to pay a membership to a gym or club, plus transportation costs. With many buildings having these amenities built in, it saves renters both money and time. Not to mention the cost of having these perks in your home as an owner would vastly outweigh what renters spend for building fees in a year!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3674\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3674\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3674\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Amenities, Gym, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/humphrey-muleba-1119283-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3674\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Humphrey Muleba from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Another benefit with renting a condo or apartment is that you are surrounded by a built-in community. Many of my good friends are people who rented beside me, went to the dog park at my building or who I just bumped into in my neighbourhood at some point. You’re surrounded by hundreds of neighbours in an apartment building, which can come in handy when you need someone to watch your dog for a day, borrow a drill for a project, or just want to get together with some new friends.</p>\n<h3>It is the best option</h3>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/young-money/student-debt-the-crippling-side-effect-of-education\">rising student debt</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/house-prices-affordability-income-1.4966211\">tough housing market</a>, many Millennials have no choice but to move back in with their parents after going to college or university. In these cases, for a young professional looking to live on their own, renting is a better option. The freedom of living on your own without the stress of the housing market allows Millennials to get closer to their dreams while saving up money and building a life.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/its-better-to-rent-than-to-buy-in-todays-housing-market.html\">new research</a> from Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University Faculty, “Renting and reinvesting the savings from renting, on average, will outperform owning and building home equity, in terms of wealth creation,” which can allow younger people to live the life they want. Traveling, being in a city, having a safe home, and chasing your career: all of this is possible and more attainable while renting. Renting isn’t throwing away money; you get to live in a place with all the amenities of owning a home, without any of the costs of upkeep! Don’t let old advice keep you from living your dream.</p>\n<p><em>Have you chosen to rent? Are you a happy homeowner?

Don’t waste time feeling embarrassed; we’ve all been there! Follow these quick tips and you’ll feel like you have a new apartment by spring.</p>\n<h3>Create a Schedule and Set Aside the Time</h3>\n<p>Start off by making a list of all the rooms in your apartment, and don’t forget coat closets or cleaning supplies closets! No two rooms will need the same amount of time; your bathroom might take 30 minutes whereas your bedroom could take half a day.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve identified the rooms you need to tackle, create a schedule and be specific about what you hope to accomplish in each room. For example, your goal for your kitchen might be to create more countertop room, or you might want to clear more wardrobe space in your bedroom.</p>\n<h3>Out with the Old</h3>\n<p>Winter clothing can truly take a beating in these harsh chilly months. Set aside a couple of hours and inspect your wardrobe. Recycle any hole-infested sweaters and worn-down thermal socks.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3617\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3617\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3617\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/dan-gold-544435-unsplash-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3617\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Dan Gold from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Clothes are one of the easiest things to collect and hoard within your home. Ask yourself, “Have I worn this in the past 6 months?” If you haven’t (be honest!) and there’s no sentimental value to it (like a wedding dress or your grandmother’s hand-knit sweater,) donate it. You’ll thank yourself later when looking for your favourite shirt doesn’t count as an arm workout.</p>\n<p>If you are anything like me, you fear getting rid of stuff because you can’t help but think, “<em>But what if I need this later?</em>” Trust me on this: You’re never going to need those hotel toiletries you snagged on your past six vacations, or that one phone charger that works when you place it just right—it’s time to toss ‘em!</p>\n<h3>Become Friends with your Countertops and Tables Again</h3>\n<p>Flat surfaces in your apartment accumulate the most clutter because it’s just so easy to let things pile up. Remove every item from the surface, including decorations, appliances and all the haphazard junk. Lay everything out on a flat surface like another table (or even the floor), so you have a clear view of each item.</p>\n<p>An easy place to start is by throwing away all the random flyers, coupons and other non-important loose papers that tend to accumulate. Next, tackle things that spark more annoyance than joy, such as decorations you don’t remember buying.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve picked the items worthy of being on your counter or table, find a permanent home for them in a convenient and logical spot. Be selective of what you keep on your counters; you don’t need to have every single appliance on the counter! If you don’t use it every day, store it in a cabinet or on top of the fridge.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Forget to Tackle the Junk Drawer</h3>\n<p>Drawers are the first place you throw miscellaneous stuff into, especially when you’re quickly tidying up. I get it; out of sight, out of mind. But this spring, we’re reversing that mindset! The purpose of a junk drawer is to provide a place to store all the little odds and ends that don&#8217;t quite fit in anywhere else. This is still possible, but it can be done in a more intentional way.</p>\n<p>Toss anything that is expired, unnecessary or is just plain garbage. Keep extra batteries, packs of pens and chip clips, but get rid of extra chopsticks, expired coupons, and that stack of random business cards.</p>\n<h3>Ready, Shreddy, Go!</h3>\n<p>Paper junk can collect quickly, like old receipts, bank invoices or even more of those random business cards. Shredding these will clear up your office space.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3623\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3623\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3623\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"De-cluttering, Spring Cleaning, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Downtown Apartments\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-169x300.jpg 169w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-770x1369.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-500x889.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2-293x521.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/felipe-bustillo-1176758-unsplash2.jpg 838w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3623\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by Felipe Bustillo from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Collections of any Kinds Have to Go</h3>\n<p>Items like books, CD’s or DVD’s can really pile up over the years. Ask yourself if these mementos are necessary, or just part of your past that you’re holding onto. It’s a brave, new virtual world, and most of us don’t even have CD/DVD players any more thanks to Netflix. So why are you wasting space for stacks of CDs from the early 2000s?</p>\n<p>The same thing goes for books. It might be nice to look like a bookworm when your friends pop by, but you know they’re mostly just taking up space. This doesn’t mean you have to give up every book but ask yourself if you’ll really ever read it again. If you won’t, donate it.</p>\n<p>Quick Tip: Donate your books to newcomer organizations (such as N.E.E.D.S) or a senior living facility!</p>\n<h3>Be Ruthless</h3>\n<p>Getting rid of stuff in your home is difficult at first because we create connections with items. But, once you get the hang of it, you’ll wonder why you didn’t tackle it sooner!</p>\n<h3>Organize the Rest</h3>\n<p>Decluttering isn’t just about getting rid of stuff; it’s also about knowing how to manage what you have. From racks, baskets, or under-bed storage, there’s an assortment of storage products for every need on the market.</p>\n<h3>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</h3>\n<p>A forgotten place that is one of the most convenient storage spaces is hiding out under your bed. Grab a few thin, narrow bins and you have the perfect place to store out of season clothes, booksyou want to keep but don’t need on your shelf, or any mish-mashed items that don’t seem to have a place but that you know you need.</p>\n<p>Shelving units are also a great way to kill two birds with one stone: Grab a few baskets and tuck away all those miscellaneous items such as cords or craft supplies. Your shelves will look neat and aesthetically pleasing, and what they hold is your little secret.</p>\n<h3>Celebrate!</h3>\n<p>Now that your hard work is over, sit back and celebrate Apartment 2.0! Now your mission is to keep your home decluttered. Remember to follow the golden rule: Only bring things into your home that you actually need and will use. Once your apartment is decluttered, it’s easy to follow into old habits and end up buying more stuff you don’t need.</p>\n<p>Before bringing something new into your home, ask yourself, “Do I need this? How will this benefit my home?” If you can’t answer both questions, don’t buy it. Another great trick is the one in, one out rule. For every item that comes into your apartment, try to get rid of one item so you don’t end up with a cluttered apartment once again.</p>\n<p>These tips might seem ambitious, but you can do it!

The menu has tons of options to try on your subsequent visits, so variety isn’t an issue. Everything is decently priced, with nothing on the menu costing more than $40. Peasant Cookery is a perfect date night spot or a place to get the girls together to enjoy a specialty cocktail. With Peasant Cookery, every bite shows you how much heart and soul go into each meal!</p>\n<p>The service matches the atmosphere: high class. No matter how busy the restaurant, is the servers are always available and will graciously help you map out the best courses for your palate.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"http://peasantcookery.ca/menus/dinner/\">Aged cheddar gnocchi</a> with the Sandman cocktail</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Fast-Food-Restaurant/Mitzis-Chicken-Finger-Restaurant-115673538494068/\">Mitzi’s Chicken Finger Restaurant</a>: $</h3>\n<p>250 St. Mary Avenue</p>\n<p>In the heart of downtown, Mitzi’s chicken finger restaurant offers Chinese and Canadian cuisine—turns out, chicken fingers are delicious with a side of rice. What makes Mitzi’s stand out is that every chicken finger is prepared fresh daily! The service is also is top-notch: the staff are friendly, and treat you like a guest, rather than a customer. It’s a great place to hit up before a Jets game or as a pit-stop on your way home from work.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong>Chicken fingers (obviously!) and a side of fried rice</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.banhmikingwpg.com/\">Banh Mi King</a>: $</h3>\n<p>510 Portage Ave</p>\n<p>Banh Mi King is one of my personal favorite restaurants in downtown Winnipeg. Banh Mi King is conveniently located near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. Everything on their menu is under $20 and offers real bang for your buck. No matter what you choose, you’ll leave satisfied and on the verge of a pleasant food coma. The service is unmatched, you will always be greeted with a warm welcome by whoever is at the cash register. They’re also happy to help you navigate through their extensive menu.</p>\n<p><em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"https://www.skipthedishes.com/banh-mi-king\">Vegetarian Vietnamese sub</a></strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://acrosstheboardcafe.com/\">Across the Board Game Café</a>: $</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3521\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3521\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BsnWJqsFzwX/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3521\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Across The Board Cafe, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3521\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside Across The Board Cafe ? by @katriz on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>211 Bannatyne Ave &amp; Main Street</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a board game fanatic or just looking for a bite to eat with a side of entertainment, this café is a great choice.

It’s been analysed, discussed and debated for a long time, but it’s never been more relevant than today: Based on a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-rent-vs-buy-reader-response-road-ahead-1.4503852\">Calgary survey</a>, young professionals who can afford to buy a house still prefer to rent. I’ve heard doctors, teachers, and other professionals argue that they find renting more convenient than buying.</p>\n<p>Personally, I rented for more than four years before buying a home, and I think renting is an underrated option. People will always have different opinions, and I find myself somewhere in between. I enjoy home ownership just outside of the city; I also enjoyed renting a 17<sup>th</sup>-floor apartment in downtown Winnipeg. Home ownership isn’t for everyone, and I’m here to show you that renting a home has more advantages than you might think.</p>\n<h3>Renting is more affordable.</h3>\n<p>When you purchase a home, you don&#8217;t just pay for the property itself. You can also look forward to taxes, mortgage interest and other fees. In addition to those basics, there will be other expenses depending on the type of property you buy. We purchased a duplex, and it wasn’t long before the extra costs started to add up: gardens, fencing, driveways and landscaping are expensive!</p>\n<p>Understanding the true cost of homeownership is not as simple as comparing a monthly mortgage payment to a rent payment. Don’t even get me started on condo fees, utilities and insurance. When buying a house, you also need to be sure that you can afford to put down a <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/mortgages/down-payment.html\">minimum of 5% for the down payment</a>. Renters, on the other hand, don’t need to worry about most of these expenses.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3440 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg\" alt=\"bank loan, mortgage insurance, buying a house, renting an apartment, winnipeg apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1024x610.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-500x298.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-300x179.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-768x457.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/account-bank-banking-1548994-1370x816.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3>No need to pay for maintenance.</h3>\n<p>Maintenance is such a huge factor that I think it deserves its own category. Here’s a great (and stinky) story about how well maintenances are usually completed by a rental company: When my husband and I came back to Winnipeg from our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, it was almost midnight. We were tired but woke right up when we opened the door to our apartment. It smelled like something had <em>died</em> in there. I ran to throw open the window, and my husband checked the kitchen.</p>\n<p>It turned out that the fridge had stopped working, and the contents of the fridge and freezer (including chicken, fish, and veggies) had been rotting for 2 weeks—yuck. You can imagine the smell! Long story short, we called the property management office, and they immediately replaced our fridge. It didn&#8217;t cost us a penny. Convinced yet? Let’s move on to the next point.</p>\n<h3>Renting = flexibility.</h3>\n<p>Usually, a rental lease is signed for a year, and then you have the option to renew. This way you have way more freedom in planning ahead. However, sometimes even the best-planned life scenario can be ruined by unplanned situations. It could be a sudden job offer in a different city, a family emergency, or you could just decide to move because the world is a beautiful place and you have to see more of it!</p>\n<p>If you rent, you don&#8217;t have to deal with selling a house. Renting offers valuable convenience when it comes to a quick change of plans. It saves you from looking for a buyer, paying a realtor, signing papers, and looking for a new place to buy. Hand over they keys to your landlord when your lease is up, and you’re free to move on.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3444 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Apartments, Renting vs Buying, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Living, 300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1024x728.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-500x356.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-300x213.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-768x546.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/rawpixel-589079-unsplash-1370x974.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></p>\n<h3>Renting involves less emotional and financial stress.</h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever been interested in buying a property, you’ve probably noticed that interest rates are rising. Mortgage interest rates are the highest they’ve been in 5 years, and it looks like they are destined to climb even more.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you cannot afford to put down 20% as a down payment, you are required to purchase mortgage insurance. Just to give a point of reference, we had to pay close to $10,000 in <a href=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/buying/mortgage-loan-insurance-for-consumers\">mortgage insurance</a> on a house purchase in the mid-$300,000 range. Property taxes in most cities have also been increasing. Taxes and interest rates add a substantial cost to home ownership that sometimes makes buying a home financially unfeasible.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, renting isn’t a money drain. You’re paying for the roof above your head and shelter for your family. You can save on monthly expenditures and have more flexibility when it comes to your life plans. Get the most bang for your buck by investing any money that you save monthly by renting instead of owning. Over 40 years, a diversified investment portfolio can yield an equal or even greater return than investing in buying a home. Renting a place doesn’t make you a homeowner, but it does free up cash flow that might otherwise be going to taxes, a mortgage, and unexpected expenses.</p>\n<h3>Make the decision that’s right for you</h3>\n<p>The decision whether to buy or rent a home shouldn’t be made lightly. It should involve being honest with yourself about what you want, what you need, and lists—lots of lists with numbers that will show you the advantages and disadvantages of either decision. Consider your lifestyle, your finances, and your plans. Whatever you decide, make the right decision for <em>you</em>, and don’t worry about what others think.</p>\n<p><em>Now, let’s hear your opinion!

It was the first time I didn’t have to live with roommates, and the first time I didn’t have to move into a furnished apartment. The Boyce Lofts were brand new and no one had lived in the space before me. It was a blank canvas (and not just because of the white walls and white cabinetry), and I was so excited to decorate and furnish it just the way I wanted.</p>\n<p>But while my apartment has high ceilings and an open concept, it’s pretty small—at around 500 square feet—and narrow enough that I can’t fit furniture on both sides of the living/dining room. So not only did I have to plan out the use of space, but I had to make sure I wasn’t filling the space with too much. I knew my already-small space would feel even smaller with clutter and large furniture. I had to be smart about decorating.</p>\n<p>I’m no design expert, but I like to think I have good taste, and I strongly believe that minimalism is the way forward. Not only does minimalism help reduce consumerism, but it helps you <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/anxiety-zen/201612/minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health\">feel</a> unburdened in the place that should matter most—home. So here are some tips on designing your small space.</p>\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n<p>When you have less space to leave things lying around, you can’t afford to have much clutter! Even if you’re not a messy person, it’s hard to keep things clean and tidy if you simply have too much stuff. It’s easy to accumulate Christmas and birthday gifts you didn’t really want, impulse buys you could’ve done without, and clothing and shoes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I understand that sometimes you just don’t want to be looking at your things, especially if it’s miscellaneous stuff you’re unsure where to store. Small-space living is your chance to get creative!</p>\n<p>Before you move into your small space, purge your belongings. Donate or sell them things you don’t want or need (<a href=\"https://www.siloam.ca/donate/donate/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=siloam%20mission&amp;utm_campaign=paid&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqt7jBRAcEiwAof2uK9QVeCxi4pU-My2leJVWHSvKIY9wy_26stHto4zZ_d46JGC9wNY6qBoCMXwQAvD_BwE\">Siloam Mission</a> gratefully accepts new and gently used clothing!). Not only will you feel unburdened from all these nonessential objects, but your small space will feel bigger and you’ll have more room to work with.</p>\n<p>For storing your belongings, opt for open shelving. Closed shelving gives the illusion that your walls are closing in and that the room is even smaller. I have an abundance of kitchen cabinet space, so I use it to store some non-kitchen related items as well.</p>\n<p>Under the bed is a great place to store items you don’t use very often. You can buy long, slim boxes exactly for this purpose, or you can even get a storage bed that has built-in storage under the mattress.</p>\n<p>If your building has storage lockers, use yours! They’re handy for storing larger items like suitcases, bicycles, and seasonal clothing. Items that are essential, but seasonal, and too clunky to be keeping in your apartment year-long.</p>\n<h3>Furniture</h3>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://hutk.ca/\">choosing furniture</a> for your small space, look for pieces that are light and don’t take up a lot of space, or that give the illusion that they don’t. Avoid big, clunky, overstuffed furniture, and choose pieces that are low to the ground and have exposed legs.</p>\n<p>Go for <a href=\"http://www.interiorillusions.ca/product-category/furniture/living-room/accent-chairs/\">sleek armless chairs</a>, and try transparent coffee tables, which won’t look like they’re taking any room at all. Think about using two small coffee tables instead of one big one that takes up a lot of space.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3430\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3430\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Interior Illusions, Interior Design, Small Space, Downtown Apartments, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"940\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-interior_illusions.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3430\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">by @interior_illusions on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Dual or multipurpose pieces are key in a small space. Consider getting an ottoman instead of a coffee table so it can do double duty as extra seating. (Bonus points if it has built-in storage!) Floor cushions also make great emergency seating for when you have guests over, and you can stack them up when you’re not using them.</p>\n<p>Look into getting an expandable or folding dining table. Keep it small when you’re alone and open it up to fit all your friends around the table the next time you’re hosting brunch.</p>\n<p>For storing things like books and <a href=\"http://intothemusic.ca/\">records</a>, opt for a shelving unit that is vertical, not horizontal. You’ll be able to store more items while taking up less floor space. If you can, install floating shelves to avoid using up precious square footage. They’re sleek, easy to set up, and you can arrange them however you like.</p>\n<p>A TV media console can take up a lot of space, so mount your television on the wall to minimize the use of floor space. I took it a step further and got a projector—they’re cheaper, much smaller, easily transportable, and a great alternative to a clunky television if you have white walls.</p>\n<h3>Decoration</h3>\n<p>Plants are the easiest way to decorate and brighten up your space. If you have a history of being bad at keeping plants alive (guilty as charged!), try a cactus or a bonsai; they’re small, cute, and can withstand being over or under watered. Stop by <a href=\"http://verdeplantdesign.com/\">Verde Plant Design</a> for a great selection!</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to decorate your walls with <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/visit/shop\">art</a> that you love. Mirrors make a space look larger, so go on the hunt for a mirror with a stylish frame. A stylish mirror can function as part of your decor, not just something you check to make sure you look good before heading out the door.</p>\n<p>Hang your curtains from the ceiling, not at the top of the window frame—it’ll create the illusion of higher ceilings and a larger space.</p>\n<p>When it comes to creating a colour palette for a small space, use colour sparingly. Use light colours for your walls and furniture, and dark or bold colours as accents only, such as throw pillows, vases, or lamps. Try to create a colour palette that uses only two to three colours.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>Where do you spend the most time? Focus your spending on that area to get the most out of your budget. If you like sleeping, invest in a bed you can’t wait to crawl into; if you like watching TV, invest in a cozy sofa; if you work from home, invest in a good working space, with a comfy chair and a nice desk. Make a plan, and don’t buy everything at once. Get the important things like your bed and your sofa first, live with it for a bit, and feel out what you need to get next; you might surprise yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Any tips for decorating a small space?

I began my downtown living journey when I was 19, and I’ve never looked back. Something about downtown caught my interest when I was ready to move from my 130 square foot dormitory into a more grown-up apartment.</p>\n<p>As a young adult, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to create a life in an urban or suburban area. The wonderful thing about downtown Winnipeg is that combines the very best parts of Winnipeg into one neighbourhood! As the years advance and I shuffle between different downtown streets, downtown feels more and more like home.</p>\n<p>Whether you love parks, museums, music venues or creative attractions, downtown Winnipeg has something to make your heart sing. Downtown really optimizes its space with something interesting to see, eat and/or do around every corner.</p>\n<h3>A Mixture of Old and New</h3>\n<p>Downtown mixes the old and the new, showcasing Winnipeg’s attachment to its historical buildings by preserving them, scattered between modernized high rises. The older buildings are comforting and make downtown feel like more than just another concrete jungle. These mature buildings are one of the major reasons why I moved and stayed downtown; they’re full of stories of what Winnipeg used to be like, and how my grandparents and parents lived their lives in these streets.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3318\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3318\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Archway at the Grain Exchange, Exchange District, Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1024x683.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-500x333.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-300x200.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-768x512.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway-1370x913.png 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/02/archway.png 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Archway at the Grain Exchange building, Winnipeg</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>You’re Never Hungry</h3>\n<p>Downtown serves as a melting pot, bringing together diverse people into one place—and it really shows through the food! There’s an assortment of eateries, which is great news for foodies like me. You can turn on to any street and be greeted by mom-and-pop bistros, one-of-a-kind cafes, or the familiar chain restaurants you can eat at just about everywhere (which I swear taste better downtown, for some reason). Food and I have a pretty steady relationship, and by living downtown I get the opportunity to experiment with all sorts of flavours!</p>\n<h3>Building Connections</h3>\n<p>Small town living has its romance, but urban living creates intense proximity between you and the people around you. It’s a common misconception that people who live in the heart of cities don’t interact with each other, but I beg to differ! You share laughs with the people at the bus stop as you joke about how Winnipeg Transit buses never seem to arrive on time, make small talk with the folks on the bus that you’re sardined against, groan along with people as you wait in the ridiculously long line at Tim’s, and smile at the person who held the elevator door open for you. These small but meaningful interactions make up the connections of downtown dwellers. You feel that connection because frankly, you can’t help it—you’re always in close proximity to someone.</p>\n<h3>The People Around You</h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that in some cities, downtown can seem cold and unwelcoming. However, I believe that the benefits of urban living can be seen in each unique neighbourhood. Each neighbourhood tells the story of the people who live there, and my neighbourhood downtown is full of people from all walks of life. In my apartment building, my neighbours include a family from across the pond who made me fresh juice when I moved in, an elderly man who gives everyone a Christmas card each year, and a few male university students who shovel the front walkway every winter without being asked. Maybe I’m lucky to know my neighbours, but with the hustle and bustle of downtown life, these types of people really shine a light on downtown Winnipeg’s unique spirit.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsx_u52AA8z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

For example, if you like being in the center of everything, consider streets in the core of downtown Winnipeg. Streets like Graham, Garry and some areas of Portage Avenue are a five-minute walk from popular bars, restaurants and Bell MTS Place.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for somewhere more cosmopolitan, right in the middle of a richly varied area—the Exchange District may be your perfect match! This vibrant neighbourhood boasts many of Winnipeg’s one-of-a-kind boutiques, coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Also, it’s near the Centennial Concert Hall and Winnipeg’s own China Town.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtNESe3AwDL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtNESe3AwDL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by @andrewmahon</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-01-29T03:56:35+00:00\">Jan 28, 2019 at 7:56pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>If you’re interested in a more laid-back neighbourhood that’s still close to entertainment, check out West Broadway. It’s known for being an unofficial boundary between the hustle bustle commercial parts of downtown and the residential areas, so you get the best of both worlds. Backing onto the Assiniboine River, it’s a picturesque area with elm tree canopies over streets and beautiful historic buildings.</p>\n<p>Do some extra exploring around the area to make sure it has your must-haves for a neighbourhood. Keep an eye out for nearby grocery stores, drugstores, and bus stops.</p>\n<p>When walking around the streets outside a potential apartment, do you feel at home? Can you picture yourself showing your friends and family around the streets near the building? That’s a good sign.</p>\n<h3>Size Does Matter</h3>\n<p>When looking for somewhere to call home, you might start to feel like Goldilocks trying to find just the right size. Starting your apartment hunt with your basic space needs figured out will make a world of difference. Consider the following for determining the square feet of your future living space.</p>\n<p>Do you own a lot of larger-scale furniture that needs to be accommodated—such as a pool table, a piano or a bulky sectional sofa? How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you want? Are you the type to spend a ton of time in your bedroom, or do you need a spacious living room? Do you love to host parties and need seating for your entourage?</p>\n<p>If you’re moving from one place to another, you might want to look for something close to the same size. If you are moving into a larger place remember that you’ll have to shell out money to fill it with furniture—an empty apartment just doesn’t feel homey!</p>\n<p>And don’t forget about storage: how much stuff do you need to store? When touring a place or even just looking at a listing on Kijiji, pay attention to the number and size of closets. Look for a bathroom closet, kitchen storage (like cupboards or a pantry) and a coat closet. A lack of storage space can go unnoticed until move-in day when you don’t know where you’re going to store your cleaning supplies or winter coats.</p>\n<h3>Nancy Drew that Apartment</h3>\n<p>There’s nothing worse than moving into an apartment and finding unpleasant surprises in the crooks and crannies, so put on that detective hat. When you view a potential apartment, look closely at ceilings, walls and floors for any cracks, stains or other damage. Check the appliances: open the refrigerator and the oven and try out the sink faucets. Look for signs of wear and tear; these may not be necessarily deal-breakers for you, but something to alert the landlord about so you don’t get dinged on your security deposit.</p>\n<p>Also, check the cellphone reception in every room! Cellphones are a huge part of our lives so make sure you walk around the apartment checking your service bars or sending a quick text or two.</p>\n<h3>Scope out the Neighbours</h3>\n<p>If you pass someone living inside the apartment building you’re touring, say hello! Whether they say hello back, stop to chat or just walk right by will give you an idea of what your potential neighbours are like.</p>\n<p>The perfect neighbours only exist in Hallmark movies, but you do want to feel comfortable with the people around you. It depends on the type of person you are but having neighbours that you can at least smile at in the hallways might be important to you.</p>\n<h3>Identify Must-Have Amenities</h3>\n<p>These are different for everyone, but here are three that we consider deal-breakers:</p>\n<p>A dishwasher: You can theoretically live without a dishwasher—but for the sake of your sanity and the environment, look for an apartment with one.</p>\n<p>An elevator: Stairs may help you with your step counter on your FitBit, but on move-in day, when you’re trying to move your couch up three flights of stairs, you’ll be kicking yourself for renting the place!</p>\n<p>Laundry facilities: Take it from someone who is a serial renter: an on-site laundry room is the holy grail of apartment living. Having to lug all your dirty clothes back and forth from a laundromat is a pain. Do yourself a favour and put a laundry room on your list of non-negotiables.</p>\n<h3>Trust Your Instincts</h3>\n<p>We don&#8217;t call the places where we live home without a reason. If the price is right but something just feels wrong—even if you can’t pinpoint what—trust that feeling and keep searching. The right apartment should be your home base, your personal launchpad for taking on the day and where you can cozy up to recharge.</p>\n<p>Have some pro tips for scoring the perfect apartment?

Walking your dog in the downtown helps you feel like you’re instantly part of a community of dog owners. Dogs are great companions; they’re your best friend, and keep you warm on a cold winter night. On a bad day, a doggie tail wiggle will definitely cheer you up.</p>\n<p>Some people say that having a dog is like having a child. I would say it’s like having a child that <em>never grows up</em>. But as dog lovers know, they’re worth the work! Having a dog while living in an apartment can actually help you stay motivated to get outside. Dogs need exercise, and can develop health problems if they don’t get enough. No one wants their furry friend to get sick!</p>\n<p>So no matter how snowy, cold, rainy, or hot it is outside, you put a leash on your excited dog and get yourself outside. Sometimes it’s eye-wateringly early and you’re dreaming about your warm bed, but Fido needs his walk. And as a bonus, you get to enjoy as much fresh air and physical activity as your pet! (Ever notice how fit some dog owners are?)</p>\n<p>But here’s the problem: Your dog is all excited about going out to see the big world, but you have no idea where to go or what route to take this time. You’re in luck: here’s a list of 5 beautiful places and parks in Winnipeg within a 20-minute walk of 300 Main Street:</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrTa1dpAcvV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrTa1dpAcvV/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by David Metcalfe (@davidmetclfe)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-12T22:06:15+00:00\">Dec 12, 2018 at 2:06pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.winnipeg.ca/PublicWorks/parksOpenSpace/OffLeashDogParks/DTDogPark.stm\">Bonnycastle Dog Park</a></strong>. The park is just a 12-minute walk from 300 Main Street. It’s located in the beautiful Assiniboine Avenue area, right across from the <a href=\"https://www.fortgarryhotel.com/\">Fort Garry Hotel</a>. I love spending summer days here, just walking around and seeing happy dog owners playing with their pets! The park even has a bottle-refill fountain that operates in the hot summer months. Bonnycastle Park was opened in February 2016 and has become very popular with downtown doggies. The off-leash park is fully fenced and has almost 13,000 square feet of playing area. Its design includes artificial turf that was specifically designed for dog parks. Take your dog to Bonnycastle dog park—I promise you both will enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>2.<a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\"> The Forks</a>.</strong> You can’t let your dog go off-leash in this heritage area, but why not combine your dog walk with some entertainment for yourself? The Forks is just a 9-minute walk away from 300 Main Street. In the summertime, wander around with an ice cream in one hand and dog’s leash in the other while listening to buskers. In the wintertime, enjoy Christmas lights, watch people skate and absorb the joyful holiday vibes. Keep in mind that the Forks can get very crowded during festivals; unless your furry friend is very used to big crowds of people, you might want to avoid busy days.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc6VNxqjs2x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc6VNxqjs2x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">every time I visit this place I make a new friend</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/93mp/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Winnipeg</a> (@93mp) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-12-20T04:56:37+00:00\">Dec 19, 2017 at 8:56pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/business/central-park/\">Central Park</a>.</strong> This park is not an off-leash dog park, but pet owners love it anyway. After a 17-minute walk away from downtown, you can stroll in a peaceful place surrounded by historical architecture. The park is also a good place for a relaxing pause if you and your dog walked for a long time and need some rest. Bring a book and settle in on a bench to enjoy a relaxing day in the park.</p>\n<p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/pdf_folder/WaterfrontDriveExpectations.pdf\">Waterfront Drive</a>.</strong> This is one of my favourite areas in Winnipeg because it combines historical and brand-new buildings with a wide sidewalk through the park. Taking a walk here feels like wandering through a picturesque forest. Dog owners, bikers, and joggers share the walking route at Waterfront Drive. The sidewalk is paved, wide, and well maintained, and runs right beside the mighty Red River. It’s a lovely place to have some quality time by yourself, with a good friend, or with your dog.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The Legislative Grounds.</strong> The park around the monumental <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a> is easily one of the best in Winnipeg for walking with your dog. The Legislative Grounds are a bit further from 300 Main, clocking in at 21 minutes at a walking pace, but it’s worth the extra effort. It’s peaceful right in the middle of the city, and it’s always full of dogs and their owners enjoying some time together. Personally, I believe the Legislative Grounds are so popular because it feels like time stands still there. As soon as you walk into the park and see the Legislative Building, you slow down, and a strong feeling of being part of history overcomes you. Seriously—just put a leash on your dog and go experience it for yourself. Just forget about your cell phone in your pocket, and lift your eyes to the ledges of the Manitoba Legislative Building. The details might surprise you.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrQCBAEDlO9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrQCBAEDlO9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mommy, look!

It can also be lonely, so some of us choose to have roommates for companionship. Whatever your reasons might be, living with roommates can be a lovely—or disastrous—experience.</p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<p>Splitting living costs means you have more money for other things. You can also create great memories with roommates. I’ve had roomies off and on in my life, particularly in my university years. One of my favourite aspects of living with others is the meshing of traditions and cultures around the holidays. One year, three of us celebrated Christmas and two celebrated Hanukkah. We decided to mash everything together and made a Chrismukkah tree. It was a traditional Christmas evergreen tree, but we covered it in blue and silver decorations (the colours of Hannukah) and used a big Star of David as a tree topper. It was fun watching the roomies who’d never had a tree try to figure out how to hang balls and baubles, as those little squeezable hooks aren’t really used for anything but Christmas decorations. We also got to teach our roommates all of the lyrics to cheesy Christmas songs. And later that school year, I learned how to celebrate Passover. We always enjoyed our combined holiday events.</p>\n<p>Being students, we had lots of silly drunken nights and sometimes came up with imaginative solutions to our problems. We had been given a TV by one set of parents, but it had no remote control. We were entirely too lazy to get up and change the channel, so one night we found some duct tape and taped all of our wooden spoons and spatulas together in a long line that reached from the couch to the TV. It served as a handy, and remarkably sturdy, remote control for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And having roommates means there is often someone there to talk to and do things with without having to schedule plans days in advance, which is a nice bonus.</p>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<p>Having roomies isn’t always idyllic. Living with others is often fraught with annoyances and drama. One of the most common fights is over cleanliness, or lack thereof. I’m sure our bathrooms were teeming with germs, as no one ever wanted to clean them. We had the same problem with dishes. No one ever believed it was their turn to wash, so the dishes just piled up in the sink in ever-teetering towers.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2955\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2955\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2955\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png\" alt=\"dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-500x340.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-300x204.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-768x522.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by rawpixel on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Your best bet to avoid similar problems is to have a conversation with your roomies right at the start, to decide what is and isn’t acceptable for everyone. You may also want to create a chore schedule so everyone knows exactly who will be doing what and by when.</p>\n<p>Another issue can be sharing food or other resources. You should decide right away if you are sharing food or keeping things completely separate. This does not guarantee success, by the way. We had one roommate in university (I’m calling her Jane to protect the guilty) who never bought her own food and pilfered from everyone else when we weren’t around. It wasn’t something we were able to successfully stop, and it was one of the reasons she ended up moving out before the year was up.</p>\n<h3>The Ugly</h3>\n<p>Some problems grow from small to breathtakingly bad. We had one roommate (surprisingly, not Jane) come back from summer break in second year with a large package in tow. She worked on her parents’ travelling carnival every summer. That year, she had fallen for a 6’8” carny and decided to bring him back to university with her. He was supposed to stay a few days, maybe a week or two, before finding his own place. He never left. He spent the entire year living with us, moving from job to job, and never contributed anything towards rent or utilities. It was an ongoing fight all year to get him to pay up or move out, but we didn’t get the big mooch to leave until we all moved out at the end of the school year.</p>\n<p>Most roommate situations don’t turn out this badly, but it’s important to know something about the person you are living with and to set clear ground rules from the start. It’s no fun if you suddenly find yourself in need of a new living situation because things have become untenable at home.</p>\n<h3>And the Downright Weird</h3>\n<p>Some roommate situations just become weird. Like Jane, who had a revolving door of friends constantly in our apartment. It’s a little disconcerting to walk into your bathroom at 7 am and find some guy you’ve never met before passed out over your toilet. (Hello, awkward conversation.)</p>\n<p>In our student apartment building, people regularly set off the fire alarm with burned popcorn and toast. But when Jane decided it would be a great idea to butt a cigarette into a wastebasket full of paper, the ensuing full-fledged fire didn’t set off the alarms until our apartment was fully consumed by smoke. Most of the damage was contained to her room, but the entire apartment had a distinctly smoky smell for weeks after. I guess my tip here is to choose your roommates wisely.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2957\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2957\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2957\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky notes, delegating, tasks, communication, assertive, apartment living, downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-500x331.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-768x509.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1370x907.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2957\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>There are benefits and drawbacks both to living alone and with others. You need to pick the option that best works for you. If you have roommates, spend a little time making the right choice or you could spend a lot of time regretting it. Set clear ground rules and expectations, and be prepared to have frank discussions when things don’t run smoothly. This happens sometimes, even with great roommates. And if you have some bad experiences, remind yourself they make great fodder for party stories later.

He would be on time for his career counselling session at <a href=\"https://manitobastart.com/\">Manitoba Start</a>, just a few blocks away. This was his first session, and he breathed an inward sigh of relief that such a great resource was so close to his apartment building. He had just arrived last week and was eager to get settled. Securing a <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/mbcard.html\">Manitoba Health Card</a> and finding a family doctor had been fairly easy. He had even been able to use the free services of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit</a> bus since everything was within a few blocks of his new apartment in downtown.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-04-17T15:34:01+00:00\">Apr 17, 2018 at 8:34am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>As he walked to his destination, Henry cast a cursory glance around him. He was amazed at the diversity; people of all ethnicities and ages walked past him, in harmony with each other yet comfortably oblivious to their own surroundings. He noticed people rushing to work, too rushed to drink their coffee yet taking the time to hold open doors for others. He was falling in love with his new home! He felt a sense of belonging and was already looking forward to the weekend. He had seen posters for <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/\">ManyFest</a> and was excited to be living a short walk from where all the action would be. As he rushed across the cross walk, he thought about his plans for the coming weekend: the festival, a visit to the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/\">public library</a> to check out their collection and perhaps some Indian cuisine at a nearby restaurant. He realized he was talking to himself as he entered the the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/downtown_winnipeg_indoor_walkway_map_2013.pdf\">Downtown Winnipeg Indoor Walkway (lovingly known as the skywalk by locals)</a> to escape the gust of wind that threatened to sweep away the documents that he had been carrying. He shook his head, smiling. He couldn’t wait to get back to his apartment to finish settling in. His days now began with sipping his morning tea while waiting for the sun to light up the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/docs/goldenboy_factsheet.pdf\">Golden Boy</a> as it serenely overlooked downtown. For the tenth time that day, he made a mental note to thank the friend who had suggested he find a place downtown to start his new life in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Heather’s iPhotos (@heathers.iphotos)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-10T05:13:20+00:00\">Dec 9, 2018 at 9:13pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>Starting a new life in an unfamiliar city can be unnerving. Resources are limited, expectations are high and there is always too much to do. That’s why it is important to choose a location that can help you get things done on the fast track. Living at the heart of the city and near all the major institutions not only saves precious time, but also gives the added advantage of being mobile even if you’re not ready to own a vehicle. It’s cost-effective to be able to walk to most places which is exactly what you’re looking for when starting your life in a new city. Better to burn calories than cents when you’re relying on your savings!</p>\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is also a great place to network, which is invaluable when you’re adjusting to a new culture and looking for a job in your field. You need to be at the right place at the right time. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html\">Service Canada</a> in <a href=\"https://portageplace.ca/\">Portage Place</a> offers free resources for job seekers.

April sees the legendary <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3824243&amp;event=Fleetwood+Mac\">Fleetwood Mac</a> come to town on the 11th, while Canadian rockers <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3823211&amp;event=Metric\">Metric</a> play on the 23rd. Country sensation <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3659325&amp;event=Carrie+Underwood%2C+Maddie+and+Tae+%26+Runaway+June\">Carrie Underwood</a> comes through on June 2nd. And taking you back to the 1980s is <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3811949&amp;event=Corey+Hart\">Corey Hart</a> on June 18th. If you go, report back on whether he still wears his sunglasses at night. (Sorry. Had to.) To see a full list of events, check out the <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/calendar/\">Bell MTS Place events calendar</a>.</p>\n<h3>Looking for Some Culture?</h3>\n<p>The ballet, opera and symphony all operate out of the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, and with the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/\">Royal Manitoba Theatre Company</a> (Royal MTC) around the corner, there is always something new to watch downtown. The <a href=\"https://buy.rwb.org/single/EventListing.aspx\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> (RWB) performs <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/romeo-juliet/\">Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> February 13th through 17th. I’ve seen this one before and can vouch for the gorgeous costumes and delightful choreography. If you’re looking for a show that will entrance young kids, the RWB will perform <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/the-wizard-of-oz/\">The Wizard of Oz</a> from May 1st to 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbopera.ca/season/the-barber-of-seville/\">Manitoba Opera</a> is putting on one of my favourite operas this spring, The Barber of Seville. This one’s a comedy, so don’t expect a long dirge. When you hear “Figaro, Figaro, Fiiiigaro!” being belted out onstage, you might recognize the famous aria featured in the Looney Tunes “Rabbit of Seville.” <a href=\"https://tickets.mbopera.ca/TheatreManager/1/login?event=281\">The Barber of Seville</a> runs April 6th, 9th and 12th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2605 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical, Musical, Theatre, Show, Downtown Winnipeg, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC), Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-500x171.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-300x103.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-768x263.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1370x470.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Tickets.aspx\">Royal MTC</a> fans, you can catch <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\">Matilda the Musical</a> (based on the Roald Dahl Book) from January 8th to February 2nd . Another option is <a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">A Doll’s House</a> from January 30st to February 16th. I’ve never heard of this one, but the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">description</a> sounds intriguing: “Henrik Ibsen’s realist masterpiece resonates more than a century after the debut of Nora Helmer, whose bourgeois illusions are shattered by the realization that she’s merely a doll in her own home.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO)</a> has events for all tastes throughout the year. The one I find most intriguing <a href=\"https://wso.ca/1819season/\">this season</a> is <a href=\"https://wso.ca/star-wars-star-trek/\">Star Wars vs. Star Trek</a>, running February 22nd to 24th. According to the WSO, “Special guest hosts Brett Megarry and Jeff Braun, from <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/winnipeg/program/couch-potatoes-cjob\">CJOB’s The Couch Potatoes</a>, settle the score with iconic music from both a galaxy far, far away and where no man has gone before.”</p>\n<p>And my last theatre recommendation is the smash musical <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=KinkyBoots&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=\">Kinky Boots</a>. The Centennial Concert Hall’s got this one from April 16th through 21st. I’ve only seen the movie version of this, and it was great. Expect the musical to be even better.</p>\n<h3>Want to Stay Warm and Burn Some Calories?</h3>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0px auto 12px; width: 50px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0px 7px; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by The Forks (@theforkswinnipeg)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-28T18:34:57+00:00\">Dec 28, 2018 at 10:34am PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/red-river-mutual-trail\">Red River Mutual Trail</a> should be open again soon (once we get some colder weather). Head down to the Forks to rent some skates and check out the world-famous <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts</a>. There are five new ones this year, including a performance hut. Norwegian ice musician <a href=\"https://wso.ca/blog/wnmf-2019-preview/\">Terje Isunget</a> will perform with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra using instruments carved from Red River ice. Sounds fascinating to me!</p>\n<p>If you want more exercise, you can always sign up for the <a href=\"https://wildwintercanoerace.com/\">Wild Winter Canoe Race</a> at <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/a-z-guide/\">Shaw Park</a> on February 16th. This involves finding a group of friends to “canoe” across the snow. (You move the canoe with your feet, like the most Canadian skateboard ever.) No need to bring your own canoe; the event will provide one for you. You can win great prizes and bragging rights.</p>\n<h3>Need Some Home Renovation or Wedding Ideas?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://winnipegrenovationshow.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2606 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png\" alt=\"Winnipeg Renovation Show, Downtown Winnipeg, RBC Convention Centre, Apartment Living, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Events, Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1021\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-500x156.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-300x93.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-768x239.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are, look no further than the <a href=\"https://www.wcc.mb.ca/\">RBC Convention Centre</a>.

However, your apartment isn’t just a place to crash—it&#8217;s your home. And every home feels livelier and friendlier with a little greenery. If you don’t consider yourself a Green Thumb, don’t be intimidated—there are voluminous solutions even for the serial plant killers out there!</p>\n<p>Here are just a few ways to bring the beauty of nature into your living space with this selection of some of the finest and easiest plants for your high-rise apartment at 300 Main.</p>\n<h3>Cacti</h3>\n<p>If you love variety, cacti are the way to go. Cacti are available in all sorts and in an abundance of shapes and sizes, making them the perfect plant to help your apartment look “sharp.”</p>\n<p>The upkeep of cacti is as simple as it gets. These easy-to-care-for plants can endure the desert, so if you have a window available, it is more than likely your apartment will be an equally equipped environment to provide these plants with everything they need to thrive. These prickly fellas only need to be watered weekly and need at least four to five hours of direct sunlight a day. Placing them on a window sill will ensure their proper growth—and you’re out of the prick zone!</p>\n<h6><em>Quick Tip:</em></h6>\n<p>During our sub-zero months here in Winnipeg, take care not to place your cacti right up against a window. Choose a higher table or stand by a window to ensure your cacti are still receiving sunlight but able to bask in your heated apartment.</p>\n<h3>Succulents</h3>\n<p>Succulents are resilient, low maintenance, and come in a variety of structures and colors, making them ideal candidates for your own planted arrangement! While succulents do enjoy light, think of them as small children at the beach: Watch that they’re not in direct sunlight for long periods of time (for example, on a window sill). Contrary to common belief, these colorful beings do not thrive when met with scorching temperatures and full-on sun exposure. Succulents need a deep watering once a week during their active growth period, but do not mistake this for drowning the vibrant plant.</p>\n<p>Indoor succulent pots do not require a drainage hole because they should never be watered so much that water leaks from the base. This attribute makes them the perfect plants to put in a hanging pot. You can let their greenery reach the highest of corners of your apartment for an aesthetically pleasing display; or consider showcasing your succulents in a terrarium. A terrarium is a fun addition to your apartment décor.</p>\n<h3>Mint Plants</h3>\n<p>You don’t need your own garden to harvest herb—mint plants flourish indoors. Place these minty seedlings on a window sill in your kitchen (or a window sill of your preference) and water them</p>\n<p>four times a week. This may seem like a hassle, but once a mint leaf has fully blossomed, you can snip it off and throw it into your tea or add some fresh flavour to an old recipe.</p>\n<h3>Basil Plants</h3>\n<p>Like mint, basil plants grow well indoors. Plop them next to your mint plants on the window sill, water every three to four days, and you’ve got your own herb garden in the making. Just like mint, basil leaves are a great resource to have in your kitchen. Chop fresh basil into your sauces or sprinkle onto your homemade pizzas. A little bit of basil tastes great in soups and stews, too.</p>\n<h6><em>Quick Tip for Mint and Basil Plants:</em></h6>\n<p>You can purchase fully-grown mint and basil plants at any local garden centre, or you can buy the seeds and grow them yourself. For the latter option, be prepared to wait two weeks before you see growth above the soil line. When you do see your own little plants popping up, the waiting will pay off!</p>\n<h3>Aloe Vera</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking for a plant with function, look no further than aloe. It may be an odd-looking plant, but it provides a useful balm that is handy for sunburns and scrapes. Of additional value, aloe helps purify your stuffy apartment air.</p>\n<p>It thrives in moist soil, so be sure to water it regularly and give it plenty of bright, indirect light.</p>\n<h3>Bamboo Plants</h3>\n<p>If the spaces near your windows are becoming crowded, consider a bamboo branch. Bamboo plants only need water and shade to survive, making them ideal houseplants for hallways, corners of rooms or areas that lack sunlight at all hours of the day.</p>\n<p>If your newly purchased bamboo plant is at the initial phases of its growth, water the young plant twice a week for the first six months. For an aged bamboo plant, watering every seven to ten days will be enough to keep your bamboo nourished and healthy.</p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2518 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Indoor Plant, Winnipeg Apartments, 300 Main Apartments, Downtown Living, Downtown Winnipeg, Plants\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-768x960.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/girl-indoors-leaves-8877672-1370x1713.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Fiddle-leaf Fig Trees</h3>\n<p>The upkeep of a fiddle-leaf fig tree is a bit trickier, but not so much that you shouldn’t enjoy its essence in your home. A fig tree is not unlike an angst-filled teenager: Give it space when needed!</p>\n<p>Place a fiddle-leaf fig tree at least five feet away from a window. This should be a space in your apartment where sun rays will hit it, but not constantly throughout the day. The watering routine will depend on the moistness of the soil. Touch the soil and if it is still wet from its last watering five days ago, leave it alone. The tree only needs to be watered when the top few inches of the soil are dry; then it’s time to give your plant a drink.</p>\n<h6><em>Quick tip:</em></h6>\n<p>Just like teenagers, fiddle-leaf fig trees have growth spurts. If you purchase the fig tree when it is just budding, expect rapid growth in the beginning. Fiddle-leaf fig trees grow as tall as six feet, but in most cases, the plant tops at four feet while indoors. If you have low ceilings in your apartment, you can trim the leaves to accompany your space.</p>\n<h3>Anthurium</h3>\n<p>If you are looking to add a pop of colour in your space, anthurium is the perfect indoor flower for apartment living. This flower can tolerate all types of light but will grow best with bright, indirect light. If you have a window with a constructed view of the sun or a surface close enough to a source of light, these are ideal locations for anthurium.</p>\n<h3>Enjoy your Urban Jungle!</h3>\n<p>Indoor pants help transform a space into a home. Adding plants is literally adding life to your home! Being intentional about bringing nature into your space will make your downtown apartment an oasis of rest from the hustle and bustle of urban living.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Between your 9-5 job, Tuesday Yoga classes and drinks with that online date, plant upkeep is at the back of your mind.

By then, the malls are flooded with well-intentioned but anxious people looking to nab some last-minute gifts. The entire experience becomes frenzied, and the joy of picking out gifts for your loved ones’ withers.</p>\n<p>And then comes the second wave of anxiety—what do you get for your friends and family members, who are all very different from each other?

If you’re like me, you pride yourself on giving thoughtful, unique gifts, making downtown the best place to find all your gifts this holiday season! Forget the headache of navigating mall parking lots and the throngs of people inside. Winnipeg’s downtown area has amazing shops, every one of them specialised in merchandise you can’t find at the mall.</p>\n<h3><b>For the Lover of the Outdoors: </b><a href=\"https://www.mec.ca/en/\"><b>MEC</b></a></h3>\n<h6><em>303 Portage Ave</em></h6>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2402\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2402\" style=\"width: 404px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BqVUGcLBRTO/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2402\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/by-MEC-828x1024.jpg\" alt=\"MEC, Mountain Equipment Coop, Gift Ideas, Unique, Outdoor, Travel Light, Downtown Winnipeg, Carry-On, Holidays, Packing\" width=\"404\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-MEC-828x1024.jpg 828w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-MEC-500x619.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-MEC-243x300.jpg 243w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-MEC-768x950.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/12/by-MEC.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2402\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @haehanna from @mec Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mec.ca/en/\">Mountain Equipment Co-op</a> has long been the go-to place for travellers and naturists.

Don’t hide from your culinary creativity because of a mess! Here are five ways to keep your kitchen from looking like a hurricane made landfall in your cupboards.</p>\n<h3>1. Learn to love your Tupperware</h3>\n<p>The dreaded Tupperware cupboard: we all have one. Despite the mysterious lids and tumbling bottoms, tackling this beast doesn’t need to be intimidating. For a smooth post-dinner clean-up, invest in a simple file organizer. Yes—the file organizer on your desk can be put to work in your kitchen, too. Slide lids in one organizer and containers in another to make packing up leftovers a cinch.</p>\n<h3>2. High rise</h3>\n<p>Don’t compromise your charming mug collection just because you’re short on storage. Get the most out of the space you have by thinking vertical! Adding a shelf riser is a quick fix that lets you store more by instantly turning one shelf into two. With all that extra space, why not see what <a href=\"https://www.tinyfeast.com/\">Tiny Feast</a> has in stock to add to your collection?</p>\n<h3>3. Stash away your sprays</h3>\n<p>The cupboard under the sink—also known as the “I’ll just throw it under there” shelf—is an organizing challenge. Finding that one particular kitchen cleaner can be easy with a little creativity: buy a tension rod (the kind you use to hang a shower curtain) and install it under the cupboard. Hook sprays on the rod to create more room on the bottom shelf for “unhangables,” such as garbage bags. For bonus points, pare your collection down to one or two earth-friendly alternatives from <a href=\"http://generationgreenwpg.com/\">Generation Green</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. Double-duty backsplash</h3>\n<p>When it comes to organizing your kitchen, don’t let space goes to waste. Lean a square of pegboard against the back wall of your kitchen counter. Simply insert hooks into the board and hang the tools you use most often to keep them handy. This customizable option can be used for measuring cups, spatulas, and even whisks.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_573\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-573\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-573 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Hanging Cups, Organizing Kitchen, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/calum-lewis-387582-unsplash-1370x2056.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-573\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Calum Lewis from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>5. Stickin’ your spices</h3>\n<p>Cooking a meal can feel intimidating when you’re fumbling through your cabinet of toppling jars, bags, and containers of spices. Head to the nearby dollar store to purchase small glass jars and magnets. With a little bit of hot glue, your made-for-the-counter jars can become fridge magnets. Fill them up with your favourite spices for an easy way to grab cinnamon or oregano while minimizing cabinet clutter.</p>\n<p>Storage spaces and gadgets don’t need to be used the way they were intended to be; with a bit of imagination, you can make your kitchen a welcoming place to whip up your favourite meals! Feeling inspired to get the rest of your home in shipshape?

If you haven’t yet, it’s time to check these out—and if you live in an apartment downtown, you don’t even need to worry about parking. Put on your favourite sneakers and your favourite jersey and head out your door to one of these stellar sporting venues.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/jets\">Winnipeg Jets</a>—<a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/\">Bell MTS Place</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"19 Years in the Making...\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pong0814/17194111246/in/photolist-scojeU-fabknM-Vw2E5S-GCUnNE-adG45D-dChbuw-bNw8bV-dP1S6G-8pYEjA-4wYGwD-9s5vk2-mFirb7-dLJJmB-dTVuKn-8UzAtT-eaEHgN-nTrLkN-jqWaLU-bdtgmZ-VqWMS6-HpUD6L-Af9RKH-dtYC62-GkfXvu-8UNoBD-9ybLpf-odBtBV-8yvpk9-YYPcy3-bDw8wP-89YEZU-T8NsuB-26SuCYV-NPuvpN-27NFWbj-71Vf6F-pYR1rU-25rCSAm-bzmH5z-foYfy1-7J7cRK-e1hEuf-dHufBu-d1TFeQ-r1ppFs-dZy8WS-8BE56p-dQa7Pv-QqfwWu-bmEtt9/\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7653/17194111246_1c70208d04_b.jpg\" alt=\"19 Years in the Making...\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>The Winnipeg Jets are, of course, the kings of downtown Winnipeg when it comes to sports. And it’s a well-deserved crown. The Jets have earned a reputation as being one of the best teams in the <a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/\">National Hockey League</a>. With young stars such as Patrik Laine, Nikolaj Ehlers, Mark Scheifele, Kyle Connor and Connor Hellebuyck making headway, this can’t-miss team has been drawing not only national, but world-wide attention for their fast and fluid style of hockey.</p>\n<p>It’s an expensive night out if you plan on taking a date to a Winnipeg Jets game, but it’s usually worth it. In the heart of downtown, there’s no bigger gem than the beautiful Bell MTS Place. Built in 2004 and standing on the former Eatons site, the arena is owned by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, a company which also owns the Winnipeg Jets. They put out a product that is highly entertaining to watch night in and night out; you’ll leave with no regrets.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has a long and rich history of being a serious-minded hockey town, dating back to the early days of the sport when the Winnipeg Victorias won three Stanley Cups in the early 1900’s. Later, in 1920, the Winnipeg Falcons (a team of Icelanders from the West End of town) captured the first-ever Olympic gold medal in ice hockey. It’s only fitting that Winnipeg would erect an enormous hockey arena and stadium right in the centre of its downtown. You can’t be a downtown Winnipegger without taking in at least one Jets game this season.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/recreation-services/duckworth-centre/index.html\">University of Winnipeg—Duckworth Centre</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sangudo/8439115766/in/photolist-dRJF6Y-9Y9KHn-8N7bE8-pVgMqQ-qiT7fm-8dzhLc-owCXRK-9zXNdZ-5WvkZg-ouZHKh-p1RBK8-GsTV7z-q2LE7K-asqBwD-qcz3eT-a1udwZ-ox6TwZ-9Y9D7H-q2uqwa-qaCqU7-9XTmYj-FoWbn-RVuq7V-ofzeaT-q2NkLa-odPGow-FtxtW2-q2Nzve-q2u6Za-qKB2un-oeZ38t-qj3q7e-6TjfKJ-89DAkC-pnaM8a-bHRS2T-pmW7io-6TepQT-oy9MRD-8CAxv7-pmXsGs-pnc2Mt-6TiMnJ-ouCk85-6K5hs2-qcqveo-owqCk4-YoJBW6-pnrSnh-KCiTZW\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8439115766_bcb1f4d59b.jpg\" alt=\"2013-01-26 Pandas vs Wesmen\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>At the University of Winnipeg campus on Portage Avenue you’ll find the beautiful Duckworth Centre, home to the University of Winnipeg’s Wesmen basketball and volleyball teams. It is both an accessible and an affordable option for high-calibre sports entertainment. It’s within walking distance of downtown at 400 Spence Street and is a stop on most of the major bus routes (should the weather be frigid).</p>\n<p>Duckworth Centre is the University of Winnipeg’s premiere athletic facility. It features a large gymnasium which includes volleyball and basketball courts, a fitness centre with an indoor running/walking track, multiple racquetball/squash/handball courts, saunas, and much more.

Unique to its kind, it also offers a comprehensive resource centre for top athletes to access a variety of physiotherapy and athletic rehabilitation treatments.

It’s one of the oldest curling clubs in the world and certainly the oldest in Western Canada.</p>\n<p>Affectionately known to curling fans as the &#8220;Mother Club&#8221;, the Granite has produced countless Canadian and world champions. The original Granite Curling Club dates all the way back to 1880. In its current downtown location, the Tudor-framed clubhouse was built in 1913 and is recognized as an official historic site of Manitoba. It is often considered to be the &#8220;St. Andrews&#8221; of curling because of its contribution to the sport in curling&#8217;s mecca.</p>\n<p>If you have a free winter evening and you’re a sports fan looking for something to do, stop on by the Granite and have a drink, watch some curling and have a good time! If you like what you see, sign up for a league and try out the game for yourself. Did you know curling is making a comeback and is one of the fastest growing sports in the prairies? Join the enthusiasm and wrangle in some friends to join a team with you.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/\">Winnipeg Goldeyes—Shaw Park</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/evilfoo/19716053528/in/photolist-w3eVPo-6Lnbv7-cGQoXf-cGQpeC-6ywTJt-cGQptu-eBz8S2-cGQmW3-cGQnwJ-4T86bw-MKkv3-59mv7D-574iVb-p9LAMF-4Amjpk-V5WJFu-o9oecJ-6DWAb5-7GFGnk-cGQiXj-6KrUpV-7mFcWn-oqT3gB-85wggY-cGQq6Q-orFMTB-cFrA7f-a5NTq8-cGQpGQ-6KvYBw-adpH4a-9VC2vz-6KrSQz-6KrXSz-6Ks4HX-22B4uKP-6y8QEt-6KrYkM-56Z8Gx-cGQqUN-6xRZqe-6vJdFJ-3gfQAA-5jGq55-eCVFG6-6KwyN7-21wkAEy-orFMLH-ac8fPj-2kB35B\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/427/19716053528_cdc55240db_b.jpg\" alt=\"St Paul Saints vs Winnipeg Goldeyes @ CHS field\" width=\"1024\" height=\"311\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>It’s hard to think of a better summertime sports option than watching a Winnipeg Goldeyes game over at Shaw Park. When tickets can be had for as little as $9, it’s a no-brainer for an evening of fun. Centrally located, adjacent to <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> (local beers and snacks of every ethnicity) and across the street from the <a href=\"http://Canadian Museum for Human Rights\">Canadian Museum for Human Rights</a>, you could even make a whole-day excursion out of a Goldeyes Game.</p>\n<p>While Winnipeggers (understandably) tend to fixate on the Jets and their standings, let’s take a moment to point out that the Goldeyes are one of the better baseball teams in the American Association, winning two league championships in the past three years. Even if you’re not an outspoken baseball fan, it’s worth your time just to see former MLB slugger Reggie Abercrombie hit some homeruns for the Goldeyes.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered why they’re called the Goldeyes, anyway? Here’s a piece of sports trivia: The club is named after the goldeye, a fish often served as a smoked delicacy and commonly called Winnipeg Goldeye. So why not take in a Goldeyes’ game and then smoke up some goldeye when you get back to your apartment after the game? That’s the make of a true Winnipegger.</p>\n<p>That’s only the beginning of the list of downtown stops for Winnipeg sports enthusiasts. Comment on your favorite spot for sports in downtown Winnipeg.

City lights, coffee shops, boutiques, food trucks, and skyscrapers; images of “urban” materialize in your mind when conversation turns to “downtown lifestyle.” It could even be the idea of walking to your workplace instead of being stuck in traffic that sways you to move into the heart of the city.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>However, when you’ve finally made the dream come true and you are living right in the center, there appears another question: How will you decorate your new apartment? How can you make this space a reflection of who you are and who you want to be? For your guests, how can your apartment be comfortable, modern and inviting? The challenge is to create a space you look forward to coming home to at the end of a day, and to like it enough that you feel free to invite in friends, family and neighbors.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Living in a small apartment doesn’t mean your space has to be boring. If you are living in downtown Winnipeg’s Exchange District, you are already surrounded by some of the most historic and beautiful architecture in Western Canada. Looking out of your window every morning is your first source of inspiration for your downtown apartment décor! <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Let me give you a few more sources of inspiration. Here are <em><b>seven easy tips to decorate your apartment with style.</b></em></p>\n<h3><b>1. Decide what you want to say through the interior design of your apartment</b>.</h3>\n<p>Our houses show the world who we are just as our clothing does. It is said, “Dress to impress. Dress for success.” I would also say, “Dress up your house so people can know who you are and what you’re about.” I love looking at the small details of someone’s home. Books on shelves, pictures on walls, and decor from foreign countries can tell a lot about the dweller. How do you want people to feel or what do you want them to know about you when they walk into your apartment? “He must be a musician, I see sheet music all around and a guitar right there in the corner”; or “I love those strict and simple lines of his furniture. He must be a pragmatic and realistic person.” When I lived in a small studio in downtown Winnipeg, I placed an open easel right beside the window along with oil colors and canvases. I didn&#8217;t have to say a single word to my guests about who I am or what I value. They could see a creative woman living in that studio just because an easel was a part of the interior.</p>\n<p><center> <a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/514888169892992854/\"></a> </center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Minimalism, modern, boho…step number two is to <b>decide on the style</b>.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>There are many sources of inspiration for new style ideas. However, before you start browsing the internet and designer magazines, make a list of what you like. Try to list colors, shades, lines and textures. Your perfect home—what does it look like? Does it have darker or lighter furniture? Would you prefer surrounding yourself with books, pillows and candles, or do you feel more relaxed in an empty and open space? <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>When your list seems complete, it’s time to start browsing. You need to describe the desired style in one word. Why? Let me give you an example based on minimalistic style. You decided that Scandinavian minimalism makes your heart beat faster. When your eyes rest on perfect wooden details, grey couches, potted plants in nooks and on sills, you are in love. This Scandinavian minimalism will become your base. White, grey and cold dusty blue will be the palette for this minimalistic style. Interior design has the same building techniques as clothing capsule; you will build, add, and create from your base. When you have a strong base, incorporating items and accessories from a different style won’t ruin your look; the spirit of your space will remain the same.</p>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/114630753000986248/\"></a></center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>3. Mix them all up!</b></h3>\n<p>In step two, you’ve done the hard work of finding one style to act as a strong base. Step three is more fun! If you want to add more life, more chic, and a professional-looking vibe to your place &#8211; mix styles. You might have a very simple grey couch in minimalistic style, but the coffee table, rugs, and wall prints are funky in a creative or modern style. Mix modern and classic, urban and traditional; many interior designers use this method. It helps breathe a sense of life into a space.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Add textures.</b></h3>\n<p>Even the most minimalistic person with the most minimalistic interior design would love to cuddle up under a warm throw on a cold winter evening. Texture adds comfort. Look for textured pillows, curtains, blankets and rugs. Textured curtains with a print mounted close to the ceiling can be a great way to add some visual height to apartment walls. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/275634439666792944/\"></a></center></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>5. Don’t forget</b><b>memorable pieces or vintage details</b>. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>What I love most about Winnipeg is the antique stores and flea markets. Among other interesting items, I have found 1920’s picture frames, extravagant lamps, and even an umbrella holder. Antique stores and flea markets are full of hidden gems that have the power to make your place look special. We’ve all been in a house or apartment that presents the finest furniture, yet it feels plastic and fake. There is no spirit of home. These houses do not reflect the owner’s vision; on the contrary, those expensive, perfect pieces of furniture only bring with them an impersonal feeling of coldness. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If you, on the other hand, are the owner of a basic, simple couch, what is the trick to making your place look and feel interesting and inviting? Try displaying vintage photo frames with pictures of your happy self or your cat (or better yet&#8211;you with your cat!), or the people most important in your life. If vintage details are not your thing, do the opposite. Allow yourself to splurge on just one unique and funky looking piece of furniture, a piece which will express your style and personality. It might be a sofa chair with curved legs, or a set of bar chairs offering an unusual shape, shade or aesthetic detail. Don’t shy away from bringing interesting pieces into your life. Have fun creatively incorporating into your décor items that are particularly meaningful to you; pieces with history or which have a story to tell.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>6. Add </b><b>color </b><b>accents.</b> <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h3>\n<p>Living in Winnipeg with its long, cold winters has its effect on our visual appetite. We crave bright colors time after time. The best way to bring more color into your daily life is through intentionally incorporating richly-colored accents and prints into your interior design. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>I love colorful pillows in my living room. When the seasons change, I change my pillows from mustard yellow to crisp, bright blue. Colors make a room look different. (Though I would recommend keeping your walls white or light grey to make the room appear more spacious.) Adding colorful pillows<b> </b>here and there can make any gloomy and snowy day seem better.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>7. Maximize space</b><b>.</b></h3>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedPin\" data-pin-width=\"medium\" data-pin-terse=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/325525879309312118/\"></a></center><br />\nLiving in a smaller space can be challenging in the way of finding storage solutions for your stuff and protecting your place from feeling or becoming overcrowded. Bring more air into any room by minimizing the clutter. Clutter could include things like overloaded piles of papers, too many countertop appliances in the kitchen, or even chairs around a table that are too close to each other. To instantly make your apartment feel more spacious, rearrange furniture pieces so they have at least two steps between them. You’ll be amazed at what this simple trick can do.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p>If I could leave only one parting tip, it would be this: Don’t be scared to be bold and brave. Life is too short to decorate your home with boring furniture. To prove it, I just purchased a yellow couch. That’s right, a yellow one!

Take a moment and peek into your garbage can. For every fruit or vegetable scrap, eggshell, pile of coffee grinds or pizza crust you see, give yourself a point. For this game we’re playing by golf rules: the lower the points, the higher the score. How did you do?</p>\n<p>Food scraps comprise a large portion of Canadian waste-bin space, but they don’t belong there! Don’t let being an apartment dweller prevent you from composting and living your best eco-friendly life.</p>\n<p>Don’t know where to begin? Here are some quick and easy tips on how you can gain your environmental karma back.</p>\n<h4>Worm Bin</h4>\n<p>For most urban renters, a compost bin is probably the best solution. Worm compost bins are one of the most resourceful compost options available for apartment dwellers. The worm method is portable and quick, as worms help process your household waste and produce nutrient-rich “worm-tea”—a beneficial addition to the soil of your household plants.</p>\n<h4><em>DIY Worm Compost Bin</em></h4>\n<p>Purchase a medium to large plastic bin with two lids: one for the top and the other to place under the bottom. Poke a few, scattered holes in the bottom of the bin for drainage, and a few holes in the top of the lid for ventilation. Place the second lid underneath the bin to catch liquid.</p>\n<p>Now onto the wiggly night-crawlers.</p>\n<p>You can purchase worms in various places around Winnipeg: your local garden centre, a vermicomposting facility (<a href=\"http://www.naturesperfectplantfood.com\">www.naturesperfectplantfood.com</a>), or even <a href=\"https://www.kijiji.ca/\">Kijiji</a>, just to name a few. To make the bin feel like home for the worms, soak the bin with water and line the sides and bottom of the bin with shredded newspapers. Lastly, spread a little soil over the paper and plop in those slimy fellas.</p>\n<p>Now that you have prepared the compost bin, you can begin throwing in your food scraps. To avoid odors and to guarantee more efficient composting, be sure to continue adding more damp newspaper strips, leaves and/or dirt along with your scraps.</p>\n<h4>Compost Bin Without the Worms</h4>\n<p>If you’re not fond of worms, you need not include them! Follow the steps above and simply omit the worms; just be prepared for the food to take a bit longer to break down.</p>\n<h4><em>Where to Store your Bin</em></h4>\n<p>Determine the best place for you. Common locations are under the sink, in an infrequently used closet, on the balcony, or even in a window flower box.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_405\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-405\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-405 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash-1370x913.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/markus-spiske-624932-unsplash.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-405\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4>Freezer Composting</h4>\n<p>The benefit of keeping compost in your freezer is that you don’t have to worry about maintaining the compost bin and it’s out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>Slide that tub of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream and that freezer-burned hamburger meat to one side to clear up some space. You can use brown paper bags, compostable plastic bags or a freezer-safe jar or tub. This composting solution is great for dropping your food waste straight from the chopping board.</p>\n<p>The only downside to this alternative is that you’ll be taking more trips to dispose of your composting drop-off.</p>\n<h4><em>Where to Take Your Compost</em></h4>\n<p>Compost can be dropped off at various locations around the city.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://greenactioncentre.ca/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-346 size-medium\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/green-action-centre-300x143.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/green-action-centre-300x143.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/green-action-centre.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Green Action Centre (<a href=\"http://www.greenactioncentre.ca\">www.greenactioncentre.ca</a>) provides a list of local places that accept compost waste; and if you’re really dedicated, Compost Winnipeg (<a href=\"http://www.compostwinnipeg.ca\">www.compostwinnipeg.ca</a>) offers home compost pick-up for a small fee. Alternatively, you might consider approaching a local community garden with an offering of your compost.<a href=\"https://www.compostwinnipeg.ca/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-345 size-medium\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Compost-Winnipeg-300x110.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"110\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Compost-Winnipeg-300x110.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Compost-Winnipeg-500x183.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Compost-Winnipeg.png 741w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h4>Blender Composting</h4>\n<p>This method is for those who want to compost their extra food bits a bit faster!</p>\n<p>You can use your blender to break down food scraps—though I would recommend skipping the avocado pits or anything too tough for your blender to tackle. Go ahead and throw those egg shells, coffee grinds, and fruit peels into the blender, add some water and let it rumble.</p>\n<p>You can easily dispose of this compost smoothie by adding small amounts to the soil of your indoor plants, or by pouring it into a flowerbed or soil patch near your apartment. With the onset of our traditional Winnipeg six-month winters, ask your friends or work colleagues if they have an outdoor compost bin you can use during the snowy months, or contact your local indoor greenhouses/gardens.</p>\n<p>Lastly, have fun with composting! Don’t think of it as a chore. It will soon become routine, just like separating your recycling from the rest of your garbage. You just may inspire your other apartment-dwelling friends and neighbours to take on an eco-friendlier lifestyle.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Food scraps comprise a large portion of Canadian waste-bin space, but they don’t belong there!
