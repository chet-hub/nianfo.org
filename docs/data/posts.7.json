It could be a powder room, a bedroom, an office, a hallway, or just a weird corner. Regardless of its size or location, the one thing you know for sure is that it isn’t working for you. You want it to change. You’re just not sure what that means or where to begin.</p>\n<p>No, I’m not about to tell you what to do with it. I am by no means an expert; I have found myself in your predicament more than once. Typically, my fix was calling my sister and brother-in-law for guidance. I’ve called them for help for something as simple as a colour choice. (At least, I thought it was simple!)</p>\n<p>I can’t offer up their phone number, but I can tell you that getting an outside opinion is never a bad idea. But who should you call?</p>\n<p>I called on Kelly Porath. Kelly is the force behind <a href=\"https://www.blueroseinteriors.com/\">Blue Rose Interiors</a>, a Winnipeg-based interior design firm. You may know Kelly from her segments on CTV Morning Live with Terri Apostle. I presented her with a hypothetical situation.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCTVMorningWPG%2Fposts%2F1692892317414267&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"512\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>The Situation</h3>\n<p>You have a great office space, but more often than not you find yourself working at your kitchen table. You have come to the conclusion that your office is simply not conducive to getting work done. It never gets direct sunlight and its decor doesn’t help. In fact, you think that it makes the room feel even smaller.</p>\n<p>You want that to change. After all, the idea of having a home office is one of the reasons you chose this apartment in the first place!</p>\n<p>With this scenario in mind, Kelly provided a few pointers to solve your office dilemma.</p>\n<p><strong>Paint</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dark colours absorb light and light ones reflect more light into the space.</li>\n<li>Never pick your paint colours in the store.</li>\n<li>Walk around the space, holding your paint sample.</li>\n<li>Consider painting the entire room a single colour to unify the space, making it feel larger.</li>\n<li>Use a neutral colour as a backdrop, and then use accent pieces to bring in colour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5928\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/close-up-colors-focus-2647714-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Mirrors</strong></p>\n<p>Reflective surfaces make a space feel larger. A mirror can make the walls feel as if they have moved out. Having said that, how you position a mirror is very important. Be aware of what the mirror will reflect and don’t install them too high. If hanging a mirror over a sofa, position the mirror so its bottom edge is 6 to 9 inches above the back of the couch. The mirror’s size should be proportional to the size of the room.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5929\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/apartment-bed-bedroom-271624-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>\n<p>In general, people will not spend time in a dark room. They’ll instinctively move to a well-lit room instead. No surprise here; you’re living that reality now!</p>\n<p>Begin by considering the ambient lighting⁠—the natural light entering the space, as well as any artificial lighting that may already exist. When decorating an office, consider task lighting. Task lighting is the light needed to perform a certain task, such as reading or working on a desktop.</p>\n<p>Finally, make sure to use a combination of table and floor lamps in order to balance the lighting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5930\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Decor, Home decor, Apartment Decor, Room Decor, Office Decor, Apartment Hacks, Decorating, Wall Painting, Furniture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/chair-clean-contemporary-1571467-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Furniture</strong></p>\n<p>The key to a well-styled room is to make sure that your furniture is proportionate to the size of the room. If you kept your favourite furnishings in your most recent move, ask yourself how well they fit your new home. Remember they were purchased to fit a different space. You may need to purchase new pieces that fit your new space.</p>\n<p>And finally, avoid “small item-itis.” Visual clutter makes a space feel smaller. Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>\n<h3>Thank you, Kelly!</h3>\n<p>Kelly provided some great tips to get you back into your hypothetical office. Many of her tips can be applied to any decorating situation!</p>\n<p>While browsing Kelly’s website, I came across this insightful line: “Your environment shapes your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.” That struck a chord with me and has made me appreciate even more the guidance that I have received over the years from my sister and brother-in law. It also really made me appreciate the value that a professional like Kelly brings to the table.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Kelly and the Blue Rose Interiors story, visit blueroseinteriors.com or find Blue Rose Interiors on Facebook.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There’s always that one room⁠—you know the one.

It’s always confounded me that the sound of dead leaves can make the air crackle with life.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></p>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3-HvVj08o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Denise Runions (@msdeerun)</a> on Oct 22, 2016 at 11:02am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My route usually starts at the Forks, where I grab a steaming cup of joe from <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>. Warming beverage in hand, I make my way west, ending up outside the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a>. Even when other people are using the path, the river walkway is a serene place to spend autumn days.</p>\n<h3>Hot Drinks to Warm You Up (&amp; Where to Find Them)</h3>\n<p>The fragrant aromas of apple cider and hot cocoa are the ultimate reminder that fall is in the air! Downtown Winnipeg is the hub for the top-of-the-line coffee shops, and the place to be to satisfy your pumpkin-spiced cravings. Coffee shops such as <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\">Fools and Horses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/home-blend\">Thom Bargen</a> or <a href=\"https://secondcup.com/location/254-edmonton-street\">Second Cup Coffee Co.</a> are some of my top-picks for their seasonal drink menus. Here are some of my favourite seasonal drinks, guaranteed to have you feeling warm and toasty from the inside out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/the-forks.html\"><strong>Fools and Horses</strong></a><br />\nFools and Horses is not afraid to get a little creative with hot fall drinks; they offer pumpkin spice lattes, but their Boreal Latte truly shines! This delicious beverage is created with one-of-a-kind ingredients including pine syrup, sage, sweetgrass, elderflower, and juniper. Trust me: it’s something special.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\"background:#FFF;border:0;border-radius:3px;margin: 1px;max-width:540px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);width:calc(100% - 2px)\">\n<div style=\"padding:16px\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></p>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;align-items: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 40px;margin-right: 14px;width: 40px\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 100px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 60px\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px\">\n<div style=\"color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:550;line-height:18px\"> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0\"></div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: row;margin-bottom: 14px;align-items: center\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px;flex-grow: 0;margin-right: 14px;margin-left: 2px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;height: 12.5px;width: 12.5px\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 50%;flex-grow: 0;height: 20px;width: 20px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 2px solid transparent;border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom: 2px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;flex-grow: 0;height: 12px;width: 16px\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0;height: 0;border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left: 8px solid transparent\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-direction: column;flex-grow: 1;justify-content: center;margin-bottom: 24px\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;margin-bottom: 6px;width: 224px\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4;border-radius: 4px;flex-grow: 0;height: 14px;width: 144px\"></div>\n</div>\n<p></a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;line-height:0;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vGhH4J4rk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by grace demers (@gracedmrs)</a> on Sep 22, 2019 at 6:52pm PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/home-blend\"><strong>Thom Bargen</strong></a><br />\nThe pumpkin spiced latte is the spokesperson for fall drinks, and in my opinion, no one does pumpkin drinks better than Thom Bargen!

Instead of waking up twenty minutes earlier to bundle up, trudge outside, and work up a sweat clearing inches of snow and ice off your car, only to then wait another miserable ten minutes for your car to warm up, you can be in bed hitting your snooze button for the third time. With heated underground parking, you don’t have to spend half of your day preparing your car for departure, you just hop in and go!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5887\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5887\" style=\"width: 819px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5887\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Heated Parking, Parkade, Underground Parkade, Winnipeg Square Parkade, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, snowy road, winter street\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-770x963.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-293x366.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/ian-keefe-kJ74b4gK-Wc-unsplash-1400x1750.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Ian Keefe from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>You’ll also have somewhere to plug in your car, guaranteeing it will start on those extra toe-numbing days that always come around in January. A warm underground parking spot will also protect your wheels from the elements, so it won’t be 100% dependent on being plugged in.</p>\n<h3>Keeping Your Car Clean</h3>\n<p>Winnipeg roads are the epitome of dirty—especially on groggy winter days when it’s almost impossible not to drive into a pothole full of brown slush. Sometimes, you just want to make your car all spiffy but fear the mix of the leftover water and Winnipeg’s frigid days. But if you’re headed back to your cozy, underground heated parking spot afterwards, you can scrub your car without a care in the world. Plus, underground parking ensures you’ll be taking fewer trips to the carwash by avoiding those extra splashes of dirt your car would receive parked on the street.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5890\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"Heated Parking, Parkade, Underground Parkade, Winnipeg Square Parkade, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, snowy road, winter street, slushy winter, muddy car\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-770x511.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-500x332.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920-1400x930.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/car-3266965_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Keeping Your Car Safe</h3>\n<p>Your car is less likely to be dinged or damaged by passing cars when it’s parked safely underground. And if you do have the misfortune of receiving a ding from a car door or a smashed bumper, most underground parking lots have security cameras. So if the offending driver didn’t leave a note, you might be able to find out how it happened. Underground parking also helps protects you from those always ill-timed street parking break-ins.</p>\n<h3>No More Parking Tickets</h3>\n<p>“Be right back, I need to go move my car!”</p>\n<p>Sound familiar? Underground parking also saves you from getting a parking ticket (or three). Many underground parking lots have you pick up a ticket when you enter and pay for your time when you leave. So no rushing to move your car each hour, or leaving your dinner date to go plug more quarters into the meter. If you have the option of including parking in your rent, that’s even more convenient!</p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FWinnipegMomOnline%2Fposts%2F1878140362231098&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"632\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></center></p>\n<h3>Save Big on Time and Energy</h3>\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is known for having limited parking on their streets, especially during the 9 to 5 on workdays.

There are a lot of options, and I find myself wondering where I should go on the longest night of art exhibitions in the city. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about that for very long this year because friends of mine already had plans in place to start off the night.</p>\n<h3>Slam! All-Star Poets Compete For Your Scores!</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/\">Thom Bargen Coffee and Tea</a></strong></p>\n<p>Having been a member of the spoken word community for a long time, I was pleased to be asked to perform at Winnipeg Poetry Slam’s Nuit Blanche event. I was also part of the Winnipeg Poetry Slam team for 2018, which later competed in the National Poetry Slam in Guelph, part of the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word.</p>\n<p>For Nuit Blanche, seven of us poets got together, and we gave art lovers a show to start off the night! It was a great opportunity for me because I was able to introduce new friends of mine to the spoken word community; they&#8217;d never been to a poetry slam before and had no idea what to expect. I find that these are often the best minds to have at a poetry slam, as they&#8217;re the most receptive and will get the most out of the poetry itself. With a small group of artists, poets, and other art enthusiasts in tow, I started us off on our journey through Nuit Blanche. Here are a few of the installations we saw as we ventured forth into the night.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fvideos%2F171998770396697%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/our-communities/metro/Whimsical-art-piece-a-first-for-Wolseley-artist-493489791.html\">&#8220;Hand of the Machine&#8221; by Solmund MacPherson</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/branchpages/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library</a> Courtyard</strong></p>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Nuit Blanche Winnipeg. Situated next to another installation (“<a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/emptyful\">emptyful</a>”) in the courtyard behind the Millennium Library was our first installation of the night: a massive and well-lit hand stretching out into the night air, with control levers that moved the fingers. In some cases, interactive art installations are built to last. But by the time we arrived, about an hour and a half into Nuit Blanche, the middle finger was broken and hanging limp in the middle of the palm. While we were there, I also saw the installation fall forward more than once, like a wrestler trying to tap out. Instead, someone picked it up and put it back into the fight. Before leaving we grabbed a few free books from the assortment the library had set up, and I played a game of oversized Connect 4.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve never herd of bison&#8221; by Kale Bonham and Todd Scott</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/\"><strong>Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park</strong></a></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fphotos%2Fa.1673473746070347%2F2146671585417225%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"535\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t think I appreciated this installation enough. It was a group of sound-activated bison next to the illumination board that lines the back side of Upper Fort Garry Park. When we got there, there wasn&#8217;t much noise to trigger the bison to react, so we moved on quickly. However, I&#8217;ve since seen images of the installation reacting to crowds of people, and it looks quite interesting!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://woodanchor.com/img_0496/\">&#8220;Run For Your Lite&#8221; by Wood Anchor and Cloverdale Forge</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/things-to-do/attractions/display,listing/05735/esplanade-riel-pedestrian-bridge\">Esplanade Riel bridge</a> landing</strong></p>\n<p>After a stop in <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/attractions/the-forks-market\">The Forks Market</a> to grab a bite to eat and a coffee, we moved on to the next few installations, but none caught my eye like this one. You could see the installation for what it was: Free energy. It took the form of a large wooden &#8220;hamster wheel&#8221; with a handle bar to grip, covered with lights and connected to turbines that would not only illuminate the installation but also power a nearby forge. The crowd was as loud as the machine itself, shouting support to friends who decided to try their hand at powering the forge!</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1895361463881573%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"622\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>We sat and watched people compete to see who could keep running the longest, all the while drawing cheers of support from onlookers. It seemed like 5 to 8 minutes was the best folks could handle before the momentum started making them slip or lose their balance. It was definitely entertaining to watch as we ate the food we bought (seating inside was impossible to find) before walking up to Waterfront to move on to the Exchange District.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://connectingcities.net/project/control-no-control\">&#8220;Control No Control&#8221; by Daniel Iregui</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/shipping-container-exhibit/\">&#8220;Container Architecture&#8221; by Winnipeg Architecture Foundation</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Bijou Park, East of Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/57144334\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Setup alongside Old Market Square, Bijou Park (which hosts Kids Fringe activities during the summer festival) hosted two displays during this year&#8217;s Nuit Blanche. On one side of the park, &#8220;Control No Control&#8221; featured a massive LED panel that reacted to both touch and sound input from the ever-growing crowd around it. On the other side of the park, nestled up to the side of Smoke&#8217;s Poutinerie, the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation set up a converted shipping container. It featured various other architectural projects around the world, showcasing the use of shipping containers as raw materials to build sustainable structures and housing. As a big supporter of sustainable living initiatives, this struck home with me.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/impulse\">&#8220;Impulse&#8221; presented by The Winnipeg Arts Council</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRG4PMlY38Y\" width=\"324\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One of the biggest installations I’ve seen, &#8220;Impulse&#8221; was a collection of massive light-beam seesaws for riders of all ages. No matter how many videos or pictures I tried to take of this spectacle, none could do it justice. Every face in Old Market Square that night was filled with excitement and exhilaration!</p>\n<p>There were many other ways for everyone to enjoy Nuit Blanche last year, including community events, gallery shows, and live exhibitions throughout the night. I hope my memories of Nuit Blanche have inspired you to make some memories of your own this year!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mark September 28 in your calendar, and share your favourite Nuit Blanche memories in the comments!</strong></em></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last summer, when whiteout parties were taking over whole blocks of downtown Winnipeg and all I saw were people in stylized white outfits, I knew there would be a white night I&#8217;d enjoy more in a few months.

I’m not sure if there’s any actual science behind that, but in my mind, it’s a fact.</p>\n<p>The days can still be hot and sunny, but the sun rises later, the mornings are cooler and a 10 pm sunset is a distant memory. It’s too early to think about winter, and definitely too early to give up on enjoying a Winnipeg summer.</p>\n<p>And to me, that means continuing to spend as much time as possible outdoors, enjoying picnics! Yes, you heard me right: good, old-fashioned picnics. Winnipeg makes it easy as, with abundant public parks and green spaces where you can spread your picnic blanket. Most Winnipeg parks are open from 7 am to 10 pm.</p>\n<p>Here is my list of four parks in Winnipeg that should be at the top of your picnic list!</p>\n<h3>Bruce Park</h3>\n<p><em>1966 Portage Ave.</em></p>\n<p>Truth be told, I never knew that Bruce Park existed until a friend told me! The embarrassing part is that I have driven by this park countless times. It just goes to show how often we don’t really notice what is right there in front of us.</p>\n<p>Sitting on 4.4 hectares of land south of Portage Avenue, and just east of the Assiniboine Park foot bridge, Bruce Park offers a number of options for picnickers. It has a few tables, a few well-placed benches, and plenty of space to roll out a blanket.</p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Quiet refuge away from the hustle and bustle of downtown life.</p>\n<p>• Parking access is available from the lane that borders the park to the west.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities only available when the pool is open.</p>\n<h3>Crescent Drive Park</h3>\n<p><em>781 Crescent Drive</em></p>\n<p>There are so many reasons to love this park. From the wildlife that shares its space, to the Red River that passes it by. Wildlife, you ask? In addition to birds and squirrels, a number of deer call Crescent Drive Park home. There’s also a monarch butterfly garden nearby. Visit at the right time of year, and you may find yourself being entertained by these little beauties.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5840\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5840\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Crescent-Drive-Park.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crescent Drive Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Natural setting along the Red River, close to <a href=\"https://www.thermea.ca/\">Thermëa</a> and the <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/golf/crescent.stm\">Crescent Drive Golf Course</a>.</p>\n<p>• Plenty of parking.</p>\n<p>• BBQ pits available.</p>\n<p>• Portable toilets provided while a new picnic shelter and washroom facilities being rebuilt.</p>\n<h3>La Barrière Park</h3>\n<p><em>4403 Waverley St.</em></p>\n<p>While not technically in Winnipeg, La Barrière Park is just too good to leave off this list!</p>\n<p>I first fell in love with La Barrière Park in winter because it’s a great place to walk my dogs. It now calls to me year-round, with or without the dogs. Its trails lead you over the La Salle River and through a mature forest where you can run, jog, or walk. The slow-moving La Salle River is quite popular with paddlers. My camera also professes a love for this park, and always finds something to capture.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5841\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5841\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5841 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Labarriere-Park.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">La Barriere Park, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Proximity to the city and variety of picnic settings to choose from.</p>\n<p>• Interesting nature trails.</p>\n<p>• BBQ pits available.</p>\n<p>• Sites available to book for larger groups.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities on site.</p>\n<h3>Assiniboine Forest</h3>\n<p><em>Situated between Chalfont Avenue to the west and Shaftsbury Boulevard to the east.</em></p>\n<p>Finally, la pièce de résistance! If you want to feel like you are in a natural park and without leaving the city, Assiniboine Forest is the place for you. This park will appeal to both the explorer and the observer in you. Its trails range in length from 1.1 km to 2.8 km, and lead you through everything from thick forest to wetlands. Make your way to the Eve Werier Memorial Pond to enjoy a beautiful observation area with plenty of seating.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5842\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5842\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5842\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Winnipeg, Picnic Winnipeg, Summer in Winnipeg, Things To Do in Winnipeg, Explore Winnipeg, Parks in Winnipeg, Winnipeg Parks, Where to chill in Winnipeg, Where to Hang out in Winnipeg, Hangout places in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/09/Assiniboine-Forest.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assiniboine Forest, photo by author Debbie Ristimaki</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><strong>Appeal:</strong> Trees, trails, wetlands, and prairie grasses make this park a microcosm of Manitoba.</p>\n<p>• Parking lot is located at the corner of Grant Avenue and Chalfont Road.</p>\n<p>• Washroom facilities available at the entrance.</p>\n<p>• Five trails to explore.</p>\n<h3>Packing Your Picnic Basket</h3>\n<p>The beauty of a picnic is that you can make it as simple or as elaborate as you want!

Whether you’re a local or just visiting, the CMHR is worth the price of admission.

Manitoba summers bring beautiful weather, and there is no shortage of things to do outside while soaking up the sun and staying active. With scenic architecture, beautiful trails, green parks, and tons of events, downtown is full things to see while you stay active this summer.</p>\n<h3>Follow the Riverwalk</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about downtown is the <a href=\"https://www.travelmanitoba.com/listings/the-forks-historic-port-and-riverwalk/6764/\">riverwalk</a>. Winnipeg is famous for the <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/river-trail\">skating trail</a> in the winter, which is among the longest in Canada, but you don’t need to wait for the ice to freeze to enjoy the sights. The river trail is a beautiful, accessible path that winds alongside our river. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the path as it stretches through <a href=\"https://www.osbornevillage.com/\">Osborne Village</a> and surrounds The Forks. It’s a gorgeous choice for a weekend stroll, and practical enough for your daily commute!</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9Mei2jg8C/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Sit down dining not really your thing? Check out downtown <a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/eat-and-drink/peg-city-grub/read,post/881/2019-winnipeg-food-truck-guide\">Winnipeg’s many food trucks</a> this summer!

This year’s competition runs from September 6 to 8, which is arguably the end of the food truck season for Winnipeg.</p>\n<h3>Soak up the Arts in the Exchange District</h3>\n<p><strong>Reggae Fest</strong><br />\nIn July, Winnipeg hosts the Winnipeg <a href=\"https://srfwpg.blogspot.com/\">Soca Reggae Festival</a>. This is one for your summer to-do list for sure! Catch the festival downtown at Winnipeg favourite, <a href=\"https://exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/\">The Cube Stage</a>.

Between the throbbing nightclubs and laid-back bars, you’re bound to have a great time anywhere you go. In a city so full of live music and things to do, it can be hard to choose where to go⁠—but The Good Will Social Club and Forth Café are two of my favourites.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://thegoodwill.ca/\">The Good Will Social Club</a></h3>\n<p>The Good Will is located at 625 Portage Avenue, near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. At first glance, it looks like an okay option to stop for a beer, and you’d be right⁠—but it’s so much more than that! The Good Will often features DJs, bands, and karaoke. Once upon a time, I took part in a spelling “beer” there! Check out their online calendar to see what they’ve got going on.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">Forth Café</a></h3>\n<p>During the day this charming café at 171 McDermot Avenue is a great place for coffee and cocktails. However, this café has a not-so-secret secret: an intimate bar downstairs and a roof-top patio with views of the Exchange. The café closes at 10:00 pm during the week, but the bar and roof-top patio are <a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">open late</a>.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwR7W2UAyqU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I spend much of my free time walking our city sites, river walks and downtown sidewalks with my trusty pup, soaking in the unique history, architecture and culture Winnipeg has to offer.","url":"https://livingat300main.ca/author/jbell/"}]}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/5790"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/users/25"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=5790"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/5790/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5800,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/5790/revisions/5800"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media/5793"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=5790"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=5790"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=5790"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":5773,"date":"2019-08-30T16:29:12","date_gmt":"2019-08-30T16:29:12","guid":{"rendered":"https://livingat300main.ca/?p=5773"},"modified":"2022-05-25T16:50:11","modified_gmt":"2022-05-25T16:50:11","slug":"why-i-loved-apartment-living","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"/why-i-loved-apartment-living/","title":{"rendered":"Why I Loved Apartment Living"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I spent almost 20 years living in apartments before moving into a house, and they were good years. I moved into my first apartment as a teenager with my parents to save money, but there were many reasons why I stuck with apartments for so long.</p>\n<h3>Location, location, location</h3>\n<p>I’ve lived in multiple cities and provinces, and my biggest reason for sticking with apartment living was always location and the convenience it brought. I’m not a driver, so I like to be in or near downtown areas where buses are plentiful and I can walk to lots of places. I spent years being able to walk to work in less than 20 minutes, and I loved it. Walking is cheap, lets you avoid rush-hour frustration, and is an easy way to get exercise outdoors. (And yes, I still walked to work in Winnipeg winters. The trick is bundling up properly, and I’ll take that over +30℃ weather any day.)</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5d5WBZSPDD\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/\">Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/embed/#?secret=5d5WBZSPDD\" data-secret=\"5d5WBZSPDD\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>It was also nice to be able to walk to the grocery store, coffee shops, and restaurants. Going to a concert downtown? No problem. I strolled right past the line-ups of cars trying to leave the venue. I was often home before most cars had been able to move two blocks. And when I lived in Osborne Village, I had several friends who lived in the neighbourhood, so get-togethers were a cinch.</p>\n<h3>Not handy? No problem</h3>\n<p>Another thing I loved about apartment living was not worrying about upkeep. I am the opposite of handy, so it helped that the most I ever had to do was reset a breaker. If something broke, such as the air conditioner or stove, I didn’t have to fix it or pay to replace it. I also never had to cut grass or shovel snow. I truly miss my shoveling-free days.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"k2InmGbGll\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you/\">Rent vs Buy: Which is Right For You?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/rent-vs-buy-which-is-right-for-you/embed/#?secret=k2InmGbGll\" data-secret=\"k2InmGbGll\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Rent vs Buy: Which is Right For You?&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Community atmosphere</h3>\n<p>I also liked the safety and sense of community I felt in an apartment building. I didn’t always know my neighbours, but sometimes I made friends and it was nice to have people to say “hello” to on my way in or out. Being a single woman for many of those years, I always felt safer in a secure building with neighbours within earshot. Being alone at night in a house (particularly if it was a large house) always brought out the worst in my imagination.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"56Cpvm1R18\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/new-to-networking-start-with-your-neighbours/\">New to Networking?

Start With Your Neighbours!&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Nice and easy</h3>\n<p>I’ve done quite a lot of moving around, and apartments were ideal for that too. I never had to worry about selling a house or what the market was like when it came time to move. I just gave my necessary notice and was off.</p>\n<p>I’ve always liked having a smaller place, too. (Even my house is small.) I like not having to furnish lots of rooms, and more importantly, I hate having to clean a big place. I could clean any of my apartments in less than an hour, so I didn’t waste my precious time on dreaded housework.</p>\n<h3>The one downside</h3>\n<p>My only beef about some of my apartments (always the older buildings) was when I had no control over the heat in winter. Those apartments were always too warm for my liking. In my last apartment, butter would half-melt on the counter because it was so hot! For this reason, I recommend looking for a relatively new building where you can control your own thermostat.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p><strong>Overall, there’s so much to like about apartment living that I’m surprised more people don’t try it. They’re missing out! What’s your favourite aspect of apartment living?</strong></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I spent almost 20 years living in apartments before moving into a house, and they were good years.
