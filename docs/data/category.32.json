There are a lot of options, and I find myself wondering where I should go on the longest night of art exhibitions in the city. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about that for very long this year because friends of mine already had plans in place to start off the night.</p>\n<h3>Slam! All-Star Poets Compete For Your Scores!</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.thombargen.com/\">Thom Bargen Coffee and Tea</a></strong></p>\n<p>Having been a member of the spoken word community for a long time, I was pleased to be asked to perform at Winnipeg Poetry Slam’s Nuit Blanche event. I was also part of the Winnipeg Poetry Slam team for 2018, which later competed in the National Poetry Slam in Guelph, part of the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word.</p>\n<p>For Nuit Blanche, seven of us poets got together, and we gave art lovers a show to start off the night! It was a great opportunity for me because I was able to introduce new friends of mine to the spoken word community; they&#8217;d never been to a poetry slam before and had no idea what to expect. I find that these are often the best minds to have at a poetry slam, as they&#8217;re the most receptive and will get the most out of the poetry itself. With a small group of artists, poets, and other art enthusiasts in tow, I started us off on our journey through Nuit Blanche. Here are a few of the installations we saw as we ventured forth into the night.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fvideos%2F171998770396697%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/our-communities/metro/Whimsical-art-piece-a-first-for-Wolseley-artist-493489791.html\">&#8220;Hand of the Machine&#8221; by Solmund MacPherson</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/branchpages/branch.aspx?mill\">Millennium Library</a> Courtyard</strong></p>\n<p>Photo courtesy of Nuit Blanche Winnipeg. Situated next to another installation (“<a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/emptyful\">emptyful</a>”) in the courtyard behind the Millennium Library was our first installation of the night: a massive and well-lit hand stretching out into the night air, with control levers that moved the fingers. In some cases, interactive art installations are built to last. But by the time we arrived, about an hour and a half into Nuit Blanche, the middle finger was broken and hanging limp in the middle of the palm. While we were there, I also saw the installation fall forward more than once, like a wrestler trying to tap out. Instead, someone picked it up and put it back into the fight. Before leaving we grabbed a few free books from the assortment the library had set up, and I played a game of oversized Connect 4.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve never herd of bison&#8221; by Kale Bonham and Todd Scott</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/\"><strong>Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park</strong></a></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fphotos%2Fa.1673473746070347%2F2146671585417225%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"535\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t think I appreciated this installation enough. It was a group of sound-activated bison next to the illumination board that lines the back side of Upper Fort Garry Park. When we got there, there wasn&#8217;t much noise to trigger the bison to react, so we moved on quickly. However, I&#8217;ve since seen images of the installation reacting to crowds of people, and it looks quite interesting!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://woodanchor.com/img_0496/\">&#8220;Run For Your Lite&#8221; by Wood Anchor and Cloverdale Forge</a></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/things-to-do/attractions/display,listing/05735/esplanade-riel-pedestrian-bridge\">Esplanade Riel bridge</a> landing</strong></p>\n<p>After a stop in <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/attractions/the-forks-market\">The Forks Market</a> to grab a bite to eat and a coffee, we moved on to the next few installations, but none caught my eye like this one. You could see the installation for what it was: Free energy. It took the form of a large wooden &#8220;hamster wheel&#8221; with a handle bar to grip, covered with lights and connected to turbines that would not only illuminate the installation but also power a nearby forge. The crowd was as loud as the machine itself, shouting support to friends who decided to try their hand at powering the forge!</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnuitblanchewinnipeg%2Fposts%2F1895361463881573%3A0&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"622\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>We sat and watched people compete to see who could keep running the longest, all the while drawing cheers of support from onlookers. It seemed like 5 to 8 minutes was the best folks could handle before the momentum started making them slip or lose their balance. It was definitely entertaining to watch as we ate the food we bought (seating inside was impossible to find) before walking up to Waterfront to move on to the Exchange District.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://connectingcities.net/project/control-no-control\">&#8220;Control No Control&#8221; by Daniel Iregui</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/shipping-container-exhibit/\">&#8220;Container Architecture&#8221; by Winnipeg Architecture Foundation</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Bijou Park, East of Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/57144334\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Setup alongside Old Market Square, Bijou Park (which hosts Kids Fringe activities during the summer festival) hosted two displays during this year&#8217;s Nuit Blanche. On one side of the park, &#8220;Control No Control&#8221; featured a massive LED panel that reacted to both touch and sound input from the ever-growing crowd around it. On the other side of the park, nestled up to the side of Smoke&#8217;s Poutinerie, the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation set up a converted shipping container. It featured various other architectural projects around the world, showcasing the use of shipping containers as raw materials to build sustainable structures and housing. As a big supporter of sustainable living initiatives, this struck home with me.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/impulse\">&#8220;Impulse&#8221; presented by The Winnipeg Arts Council</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Old Market Square</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRG4PMlY38Y\" width=\"324\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One of the biggest installations I’ve seen, &#8220;Impulse&#8221; was a collection of massive light-beam seesaws for riders of all ages. No matter how many videos or pictures I tried to take of this spectacle, none could do it justice. Every face in Old Market Square that night was filled with excitement and exhilaration!</p>\n<p>There were many other ways for everyone to enjoy Nuit Blanche last year, including community events, gallery shows, and live exhibitions throughout the night. I hope my memories of Nuit Blanche have inspired you to make some memories of your own this year!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mark September 28 in your calendar, and share your favourite Nuit Blanche memories in the comments!</strong></em></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last summer, when whiteout parties were taking over whole blocks of downtown Winnipeg and all I saw were people in stylized white outfits, I knew there would be a white night I&#8217;d enjoy more in a few months.

Erica made the living room garden a beautiful piece of art that people can really connect with.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5753\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5753\" style=\"width: 720px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/living-living-room\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5753\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NI8ugsmh-720-478.jpg\" alt=\"Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/NI8ugsmh-720-478.jpg 720w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/NI8ugsmh-720-478-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/NI8ugsmh-720-478-500x332.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/NI8ugsmh-720-478-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/NI8ugsmh-720-478-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5753\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Orioles Community Centre, living living room by Erica Swendrowski — Photo by Robert Tinker</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>In her proposal for the project, Erica wrote, “For generations, community gardens have provided city dwellers with opportunities to grow healthy food close to home.” Erica’s “living living rooms” were integrated into community gardens at the <a href=\"http://valourcc.ca/facilities/orioles/\">Orioles Community Centre</a>, the <a href=\"http://lordrobertscc.ca/\">Lord Roberts Community Centre</a>, and the Millennium Garden. The project’s ambitions were to connect local gardeners and to help new relationships “blossom”.</p>\n<p>When I first saw the piece, I was in awe of Erica’s ability to create something that felt so familiar. Living rooms are places of comfort, where we gather with friends and family; they’re filled with memories of holidays, parties and cuddling up to watch your favourite tv shows. Building something that feels so homey encourages people to feel welcomed. I think that sense of togetherness probably made more people want to participate in up-keeping the community gardens where Erica built her creations.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5754\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5754\" style=\"width: 720px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/artwork/living-living-room\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5754\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478.jpg\" alt=\"Public Arts Winnipeg, Public Arts, Arts, Living Living Room, Winnipeg Arts Council, Winnipeg Arts, Winnipeg Downtown, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478.jpg 720w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-500x332.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/08/3BZHoy2N-720-478-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Garden Bus Tour, West Broadway, living living room by Erica Swendrowski — Photo by Robert Tinker</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I also appreciate the creative relationship between the traditionally-shaped living room “furniture” and the earthy materials and tones. As a place to spend time together, living rooms are a central part of our homes. The natural materials of these pieces remind us that ultimately, the earth is the home we all share.</p>\n<p>In Winnipeg, we’re lucky to have green spaces throughout the city. I hope these pieces helped those who saw them connect with the idea of how important it is to take care of the environment.</p>\n<p><em><strong>You can <a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/pubart-about\">learn more about the Public Art Program</a> and <a href=\"http://winnipegarts.ca/wac/pubart-gal/\">view all the public artworks</a> on the Winnipeg Art Council’s website.

Start With Your Neighbours!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Networking—a fancy term for a simple idea. Meet people, interact with them and build new relationships. We’re so used to networking through social media that the thought of physically interacting with people might sound a little bit alien. You could have 300 people on your <a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> network, another 300 on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>, and not know any of them well enough to know where they are from. Friendly relations between neighbours encourages real-life networking, and as old school as it may sound, it’s so valuable. Everyone has a story to tell, and you would probably miss the most interesting chapters if you had the same conversation online.</p>\n<p>Humans are social by nature; we need to have meaningful conversations with other people to satisfy our natural instinct to know one another. Community meet-ups and common areas encourage networking with those around us. Networking doesn’t necessarily mean meeting with influential people who can help you professionally; it can also include people you can really connect with on an intellectual level. Many apartment buildings have common areas so people can lounge and get to know each other. Events like BBQs, pool parties, breakfasts and evening tea encourage tenants to get familiar with each other. While these events may seem like just a casual breakfast (free food!), they’re also opportunities to discuss concerns and get valuable information. For example, downtown apartment dwellers might be happy to learn about the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/programs-services/safety/watch-ambassadors/\">Downtown Watch Ambassadors</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwK8cMVg5YP/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwK8cMVg5YP/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2019-04-12T21:43:42+00:00\">Apr 12, 2019 at 2:43pm PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></center></p>\n<p>Networking isn’t just about advancing your career; it’s also about bonds between neighbours, an important part of apartment living. Being on good terms with your neighbours means you have someone to turn to in case of an emergency, or just to call over for a cup of tea if you’re having a bad day and need someone to talk to. You can surround yourself with people you trust who can eventually become part of your support system. Good neighbours can end up feeling like family when you’re living alone.</p>\n<p>The great thing about downtown Winnipeg is the strong sense of community that the area promotes. Most apartment buildings are designed to have spaces for general use. Downtown boasts wonderful cultural diversity, making networking even more fun! You can get to know people from varied backgrounds, find out first-hand details about other cultures, and learn about entirely different ways of life.</p>\n<p>My apartment building used to have the best BBQ parties for tenants where we would all just chat; it was fun to find out that I had a police officer and ballet dancer living on the same floor as me. At one BBQ, I saw a distinguished-looking gentleman hand over his business card to a student looking for an internship. It felt so good to be living in a community where people were looking out for each other and helping out where they could. These meet-ups can even help recent immigrants build their social circles and meet new people.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4665 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/alexis-brown-85793-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"New to Networking?

You might scoff and think there’s no way you want to move around this frigid city without one, but not everyone has access to a vehicle. Others are also worried about the environmental damage cars do.</p>\n<p>As someone who doesn’t drive, I’ve spent all of my adult life trying to move around cities without a vehicle. And I promise you, you can do it. Let’s look at your options.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en\">Winnipeg Transit</a></h3>\n<p>You can ride the good ol’ bus to move around our city. The service isn’t great from some outlying suburban areas, but you can reach most everywhere by bus. And it’s easy to figure out, too. There’s a Winnipeg Transit app you can download onto your phone. You can also use the Winnipeg Transit <a href=\"https://m.winnipegtransit.com/navigo\">Navigo website</a>.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4648\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4648\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4648\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2416-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Transit, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-100x100.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-770x770.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-293x293.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-390x390.jpg 390w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-585x585.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-900x900.jpg 900w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-1400x1400.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/05/IMG_2416-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4648\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Very Canadian</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>With either version, you enter your departing address, your destination, and the time you need to arrive or leave. Navigo will then show you all your options to get where you are going, including walking time and time between transfers. You can also monitor a particular stop if you want to see when buses will arrive. The app/website shows where buses are in real time by tracking the fleet with GPS. This takes the guesswork out of knowing when your bus will arrive, which is particularly helpful on nasty weather days. The city could do better with transit, and we need more rapid transit routes, but this is one way you can get around Winnipeg.</p>\n<p>If you need to get around downtown, you can hop aboard one of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/en/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit buses</a>. They take a couple of different routes through the downtown area. The best part? <strong>The Downtown Spirit is always free!</strong></p>\n<h3>Your Bike</h3>\n<p>If you want to stay in shape and avoid all carbon emissions, cycling might be the way to go. And yes, you can cycle here year-round. (At least if you’re the hardy type.) The advent of fat bike tires can help you with winter cycling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><center></center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbiIIHEBsQ_/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbiIIHEBsQ_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Winnipeg, we never put our bikes away&#8230; we just let some air out of the tires and go about our day!! . . . #canon60D #donsaction #Winnipeg #exploremb #explorecanada #artofvisuals #visualsgang #royalsnappingartist #way2ill #gramslayers #cityscape #paradisecanada #TrailsManitoba #exploreeverything #onlyinthepeg #allthingswinnipeg #visualscollective #world_great #discoverearth #discoverglobe #imagesofcanada #tourcanada #paradisecanada #moodygrams #agameoftones #vscogram #visualambassadors #visualcreators #canadagram #winteriscoming</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\">A post shared by <a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshuaa_blade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Josh</a> (@joshuaa_blade) on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2017-11-15T22:49:05+00:00\">Nov 15, 2017 at 2:49pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>While you can cycle all city streets in Winnipeg, not everyone loves sharing the road with larger, faster moving cars. The city does have a series of dedicated bike routes, including downtown bike lanes. If you aren’t sure where to find these, the city provides a number of <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/pedestriansCycling/maps/default.stm\">bike maps to help you plan your trip</a>.</p>\n<p>Biking is a great way to see Winnipeg, particularly many of our downtown parks and pretty spaces!</p>\n<h3>Your Feet</h3>\n<p>Another great way to get in your daily exercise and protect the environment is by simply using your feet to move you from point A to point B. I used to live in <a href=\"https://www.osbornevillage.com/\">Osborne Village</a> and walked to work downtown every day, even in -35 degree weather.</p>\n<p>You can’t walk everywhere, but consider walking for your shorter trips. You will need good shoes (or good winter boots with grip) to stay comfortable, but those are far cheaper than a car. Wearing a good base layer or snow pants with your coat, hat and mitts can keep you nice and toasty in the winter. You also generate a fair amount of body heat when you’re moving around. Just make sure you invest in good quality gear; the super-cheap stuff might leave you too cold or too sweaty under your coat.</p>\n<p>Walking is great for your health, as is spending time outdoors in general. It can be difficult to walk down sidewalks in winter before the plows come up, but you can use the street instead (in residential areas). Or, you could truly embrace our winters and pull out your snowshoes!</p>\n<p>Downtown is a great place to walk, particularly around <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/\">The Forks</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/jubapark.shtml\">Stephen Juba Park</a>. You will find many pretty things to see as you promenade along the water. In the winter, you can walk on the Red or Assiniboine and see all of the delightful <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts near the Forks</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.tappcar.com/\">Tapp Car</a></h3>\n<p>There might be times when you need to get somewhere that isn’t easily accessible except by car. You can use our local taxi services, but I quite enjoy Tapp Car, Winnipeg’s answer to <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/ca/en/\">Uber</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/\">Lyft</a>. We have a few other rideshare services in the city, but I can only vouch for Tapp Car, which was the first player here.</p>\n<p>They have an easy-to-use app that shows how long it will take your car to get to you, and shows the car make, model, colour and license plate, along with your driver’s name. This is nice to know for safety reasons. The cars are always clean, and the drivers are generally friendly. You set up payment directly in the app, so you don’t have to fuss with cash or a debit machine when you arrive at your destination.

Whether you’re a die-hard hockey fan or just want to support Winnipeg’s team, the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wpgwhiteout/\">#WinnipegWhiteout</a> gives you a chance to come together and celebrate!</p>\n<h3>What to Expect</h3>\n<p>The energy on the streets during the whiteout is unmatched. There’s something special about half of your city piling onto the streets, decked out in white and the hometown team’s apparel.</p>\n<p>Starting this year, there’s a cover fee of $5.00, but the fun you will have is priceless. All proceeds are going to <a href=\"https://unitedwaywinnipeg.ca/\">The United Way</a>, which will scatter the funds to several organizations in the city helping individuals with mental health and addiction services.</p>\n<p>But that seems to be the only thing that’s changing—seasoned whiteout goers can expect to see the same parties, with huge screens playing the game, local food trucks, beverages (both adult and youth-friendly), snacks, and activities. If you have tots in tow, the alcohol-free family zone at the <a href=\"http://winnipeglibraryfoundation.ca/tour-the-park/\">Millennium Library Park</a> has room for up to 4,000 people!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4185\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Cup, Winnipeg White Out Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Events, Go Jets Go, Winnipeg Jets, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Ice Hockey, Sports, Game Day, #WPGWhiteOut\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-770x578.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/FullSizeRender-1-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h3>Prepare for a Whiteout</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties start exactly 2 hours before each game and the streets get packed fast, so make sure to get there on time if you want to get the full whiteout experience. <a href=\"https://www1.ticketmaster.ca/winnipeg-jets-whiteout-street-party-home-game-2/event/11005682CCE54415\">Buying a ticket</a> doesn’t guarantee you a spot on the street. The street party is capped at 15,000 people for safety reasons (unless you have a ticket to the game).</p>\n<p>From personal experience, I recommend coordinating beforehand if you’re meeting a group of friends. Cell reception can be a bit dodgy and slow with the giant mass amount of people around you, and texting them “I’m by the screen, I’m the one wearing white!” doesn’t exactly work in this situation.</p>\n<p>Don’t have a white Winnipeg Jets jersey? Don’t fret! Every white get-up is welcome, even a basic white tee-shirt. If you’re feeling extra festive, get creative! Grab a white wig, a white tutu, or whatever—there’s no better time to bust out that funky white hat stored in your Halloween costume box.</p>\n<h3>Pack the Essentials</h3>\n<p>Water bottle and a snack: You’re going to spend hours watching the game, chatting with your friends, and just enjoying the hustle and bustle of the party. Stay hydrated and energized by keeping a small snack and a water bottle with you. This also will save you a few bucks!</p>\n<p>Battery Pack: You’re going to want to capture every Instagram-worthy moment, and that is going to drain your phone fast!</p>\n<p>Jacket: As we get further into spring, we Winnipeggers tend to get a bit overconfident about what will be warm enough for us to wear. It may not be that cold at 5 pm when the parties start, but towards the end of the night, you’ll want something to wrap around you. Pack a lightweight jacket (white, obviously) just in case!</p>\n<h3>Get Around Downtown</h3>\n<p>Whiteout parties are great for those of us going, but if you can’t make the excitement, navigating around downtown can be torturous! Here are the roads that will be closed during whiteout parties:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economicdevelopmentwinnipeg.com/winnipeg-whiteout/maps-and-resources?camefrom=EMCL_2841648_134922198\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4181 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg Whiteout Street Party, Downtown Winnipeg, Winnipeg Jets, Go Jets Go, NHL Playoffs, Hockey Playoffs, Game Day, Sports, Downtown Living\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-232x300.jpg 232w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-770x996.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-500x647.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-293x379.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1-1400x1812.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/wpgwhiteout_sp_map.1.jpg 1700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" /></a></p>\n<p>• Donald between Portage and St. Mary<br />\n• Graham between Hargrave and Smith<br />\n• Smith between Portage and St. Mary</p>\n<p>These streets will be closed from 11:30 a.m. Friday through 6:30 a.m. Saturday for today’s party.</p>\n<h3>Personal Experience</h3>\n<p>My first whiteout was last spring, and as soon as I jumped off the bus onto Graham street, it was if I walked into a different dimension! For as far as my eyes could see, everyone was decked out in white. My nose quickly caught a whiff of the food trucks surrounding me, and my ears were bulldozed with the laughter and chatter of the crowd around me. I followed a mass of people to the center of the street, where hundreds upon hundreds of people were already gathered, getting ready for the game to light up the massive screen in front of us.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be a die-hard fan for the excitement to exist in you. Before experiencing my first whiteout, I enjoyed the occasional hockey game. But as soon as the screen switched on and the first puck hit the ice, I was roaring in unison with the crowd around me. We were loud and proud, screaming the second the Jets hit the ice, singing along to the Canadian anthem, and we kept up that enthusiasm until seconds before the Jets sunk their winning goal at the end of the game. It was like the entire crowd—no, the entire city—was holding its breath. Silence overcame the streets as our eyes were glued to the screen, waiting for the puck to hit net. As soon as it did, we were like a shaken soda bottle—the street exploded in deafening cheers! There must be cracks in the foundations of the buildings around us thanks to the deafening noise the Winnipeggers on the streets were making. I am honestly surprised we didn’t get a noise complaint from our neighboring city. I hugged everyone around me, people I had never seen before—but they felt like long-lost friends.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwGJe-dA0AP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Winnipeg and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to know each other yet.</p>\n<p>The next few times when I visited Winnipeg with friends, we mainly went shopping at <a href=\"https://www.cfshops.com/polo-park.html\">Polo Park</a>. To really get to know the city, you need to get out and explore its oldest parts. You must open your eyes to seeing history, and your ears to hearing what the city wants to tell you. That is exactly what happened to me when I came back to Winnipeg with a pile of documents to apply to college.</p>\n<p>That morning, my sister and I had one specific mission: to explore. We got Starbucks and started our walk from the <a href=\"https://www.fairmont.com/winnipeg/\">Fairmont Hotel</a> on Portage Avenue, through the <a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/\">Exchange District</a>, and back to Portage Avenue. I was lifting my eyes, trying to catch architectural details on buildings like the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank on Main Street</a>, <a href=\"http://pantagesplayhouse.com/\">Pantages Playhouse Theatre</a> on Market Street, the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> on King Street, and others. I was enjoying the fresh summer morning air and a strong feeling of familiarity that was pressing on me from all sides. It was a long walk, but that morning something hit me. It was <em>déjà vu</em> feeling that I had already been in this place before. I felt like I&#8217;d seen it before, and not just once.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3876\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3876\" style=\"width: 819px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSe9ybtBCjl/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3876 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-770x963.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson-293x366.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/by-arianneyuson.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by @arianneyuson from Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Later, while studying in college and spending all my free time in the Exchange District, I found out that movies about early 20th century Chicago had been shot in Winnipeg. Puzzle pieces fell into place. That is where I had seen these streets before I fell in love with them! I&#8217;d seen the <a href=\"https://mbfilmmusic.ca/en/film/filming-in-manitoba\">streets of Winnipeg in movies</a> when I still lived in Russia.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg has been called &#8220;Little Chicago&#8221; or most commonly &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_District\">The Chicago of the North</a>&#8221; for good reason. At the turn of the century, Chicago and Winnipeg were rivals. Is that hard to believe? Before World War I, Winnipeg was the fastest-growing city in North America. By 1911 Winnipeg was the third-largest city in Canada. Winnipeg, like Chicago, was an international finance, industry, and transportation hub. From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, Chicago architects came to Winnipeg to practice their art and technique in buildings designs. They designed many buildings in the Exchange District. The Chicago architects&#8217; style influenced and inspired local Winnipeg architects, and the city kept growing in the Chicago style.</p>\n<p>One of the best examples of the Chicago style is the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/maltesecrossbuilding.shtml\">Maltese Cross Building</a> at 66 King Street. Personally, this building always made my imagination run towards early <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/\">Woody Allen</a> movies about New York, love, and love in New York. (Even though we’re talking about Chicago.) The building was designed by <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/atchison_jd.shtml\">J.D. Atchison</a>, a Chicago architect who moved to Winnipeg in 1905. Atchison designed nearly 100 buildings in the Exchange District area.</p>\n<p>I also want to highlight the <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/confederationbuilding.shtml\">Confederation Life Building on Main Street</a>. I remember walking by that building, staring at its detail and marvelling at how much effort and creativity someone had to put into it. The Confederation Life Building was designed by a Toronto architect named <a href=\"https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=5950\">Wilson Gray</a>, who was influenced by Chicago style. This building is such an example of power, dignity, and strength that it takes your breath just for a moment. Next time you walk downtown and turn on Main Street, pay attention to the roof of the building. I promise, the details will surprise you, and perhaps inspire you to create something beautiful yourself.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3874\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/DSC01294-2-1400x934.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Many locations in Winnipeg were inspired by the Chicago style. That’s why film directors do not hesitate to use Winnipeg streets as location sets when a plot includes scenes in 20th century Chicago. &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358135/locations\">Shall We Dance</a>,&#8221; with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, was shot in Winnipeg but set in Chicago. Just writing this makes me want to watch that movie again and point out all the familiar streets that now hold so many memories for me.</p>\n<p>Other common links between Winnipeg and Chicago are water and wind. Chicago is located on the shores of Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River; Winnipeg was born at the cross of the Assiniboine and Red rivers. Both cities are built on an open prairie area near a fresh water source. At the beginning of 20th century, Winnipeg was a transportation hub, with access to one of the longest rivers in Canada (the Assiniboine River stretches over 1,070 kilometres).</p>\n<p>Being built on open shores of lakes and rivers explains why both cities are known as windy cities. The average wind speed in Chicago is 16.6 km/hr, while Winnipeg wind speeds can reach 17.1 km/hr. If you think those are not big numbers, try to stand at the intersection of Portage and Main on a cold and windy February afternoon! Winnipeg’s wind speed is the second highest of any city in Canada, after Regina, Saskatchewan (18.4 km/hr). Chicago is also in second place, after Boston, Massachusetts (20.0 km/hr). On November 20, 1892, the Freeborn County Standard of Albert Lea, Minnesota, had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windy_City_(nickname)\">this to say</a> about Chicago being called the Windy City:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3880 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/04/Portage-and-Main.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“But in another sense, Chicago is actually earning the title of the ‘windy’ city. It is one of the effects of the tall buildings, which engineers and architects apparently did not foresee that the wind is sucked down into the streets. Go ahead and walk past the Masonic Temple or the Auditorium. A day that may be perfectly calm elsewhere, will meet you with a lively breeze at the base of the buildings that will compel you to put your hand to your hat.”</p>\n<p>I’ve experienced exactly that many times while walking in downtown Winnipeg. The summer wind always tries to take my hats (but I always catch them, and lucky strangers get a laugh as I jog after my hat).</p>\n<p>Winnipeg, the Chicago of the North, has everything you need to take a trip back in time and land in 1905 Chicago. Chicago’s influence is all around: J.D. Atchison designed both the <a href=\"https://www.cmu.ca/\">Canadian Mennonite University</a>, the stunning <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/unionbankbuilding.shtml\">Union Bank Building</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.virtual.heritagewinnipeg.com/vignettes/vignettes_039.htm\">Great-West Life building on Lombard Avenue</a>.</p>\n<p>The architecture in our city is beautiful and artistic; open your eyes, turn on your imagination, and maybe even look into the history of your favourite buildings. The effort is so worth it.</p>\n<p><em>Now, it is your turn to share!

With Peasant Cookery, every bite shows you how much heart and soul go into each meal!</p>\n<p>The service matches the atmosphere: high class. No matter how busy the restaurant, is the servers are always available and will graciously help you map out the best courses for your palate.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"http://peasantcookery.ca/menus/dinner/\">Aged cheddar gnocchi</a> with the Sandman cocktail</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Fast-Food-Restaurant/Mitzis-Chicken-Finger-Restaurant-115673538494068/\">Mitzi’s Chicken Finger Restaurant</a>: $</h3>\n<p>250 St. Mary Avenue</p>\n<p>In the heart of downtown, Mitzi’s chicken finger restaurant offers Chinese and Canadian cuisine—turns out, chicken fingers are delicious with a side of rice. What makes Mitzi’s stand out is that every chicken finger is prepared fresh daily! The service is also is top-notch: the staff are friendly, and treat you like a guest, rather than a customer. It’s a great place to hit up before a Jets game or as a pit-stop on your way home from work.</p>\n<p><em>My recommendation:</em> <strong>Chicken fingers (obviously!) and a side of fried rice</strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.banhmikingwpg.com/\">Banh Mi King</a>: $</h3>\n<p>510 Portage Ave</p>\n<p>Banh Mi King is one of my personal favorite restaurants in downtown Winnipeg. Banh Mi King is conveniently located near the <a href=\"https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/\">University of Winnipeg</a>. Everything on their menu is under $20 and offers real bang for your buck. No matter what you choose, you’ll leave satisfied and on the verge of a pleasant food coma. The service is unmatched, you will always be greeted with a warm welcome by whoever is at the cash register. They’re also happy to help you navigate through their extensive menu.</p>\n<p><em>My Recommendation:</em> <strong><a href=\"https://www.skipthedishes.com/banh-mi-king\">Vegetarian Vietnamese sub</a></strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://acrosstheboardcafe.com/\">Across the Board Game Café</a>: $</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3521\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3521\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BsnWJqsFzwX/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3521\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Across The Board Cafe, Winnipeg Restaurants, Downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/03/by-katriz.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3521\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside Across The Board Cafe ? by @katriz on Instagram</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>211 Bannatyne Ave &amp; Main Street</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a board game fanatic or just looking for a bite to eat with a side of entertainment, this café is a great choice.

It’s known for being an unofficial boundary between the hustle bustle commercial parts of downtown and the residential areas, so you get the best of both worlds. Backing onto the Assiniboine River, it’s a picturesque area with elm tree canopies over streets and beautiful historic buildings.</p>\n<p>Do some extra exploring around the area to make sure it has your must-haves for a neighbourhood. Keep an eye out for nearby grocery stores, drugstores, and bus stops.</p>\n<p>When walking around the streets outside a potential apartment, do you feel at home? Can you picture yourself showing your friends and family around the streets near the building? That’s a good sign.</p>\n<h3>Size Does Matter</h3>\n<p>When looking for somewhere to call home, you might start to feel like Goldilocks trying to find just the right size. Starting your apartment hunt with your basic space needs figured out will make a world of difference. Consider the following for determining the square feet of your future living space.</p>\n<p>Do you own a lot of larger-scale furniture that needs to be accommodated—such as a pool table, a piano or a bulky sectional sofa? How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you want? Are you the type to spend a ton of time in your bedroom, or do you need a spacious living room? Do you love to host parties and need seating for your entourage?</p>\n<p>If you’re moving from one place to another, you might want to look for something close to the same size. If you are moving into a larger place remember that you’ll have to shell out money to fill it with furniture—an empty apartment just doesn’t feel homey!</p>\n<p>And don’t forget about storage: how much stuff do you need to store? When touring a place or even just looking at a listing on Kijiji, pay attention to the number and size of closets. Look for a bathroom closet, kitchen storage (like cupboards or a pantry) and a coat closet. A lack of storage space can go unnoticed until move-in day when you don’t know where you’re going to store your cleaning supplies or winter coats.</p>\n<h3>Nancy Drew that Apartment</h3>\n<p>There’s nothing worse than moving into an apartment and finding unpleasant surprises in the crooks and crannies, so put on that detective hat. When you view a potential apartment, look closely at ceilings, walls and floors for any cracks, stains or other damage. Check the appliances: open the refrigerator and the oven and try out the sink faucets. Look for signs of wear and tear; these may not be necessarily deal-breakers for you, but something to alert the landlord about so you don’t get dinged on your security deposit.</p>\n<p>Also, check the cellphone reception in every room! Cellphones are a huge part of our lives so make sure you walk around the apartment checking your service bars or sending a quick text or two.</p>\n<h3>Scope out the Neighbours</h3>\n<p>If you pass someone living inside the apartment building you’re touring, say hello! Whether they say hello back, stop to chat or just walk right by will give you an idea of what your potential neighbours are like.</p>\n<p>The perfect neighbours only exist in Hallmark movies, but you do want to feel comfortable with the people around you. It depends on the type of person you are but having neighbours that you can at least smile at in the hallways might be important to you.</p>\n<h3>Identify Must-Have Amenities</h3>\n<p>These are different for everyone, but here are three that we consider deal-breakers:</p>\n<p>A dishwasher: You can theoretically live without a dishwasher—but for the sake of your sanity and the environment, look for an apartment with one.</p>\n<p>An elevator: Stairs may help you with your step counter on your FitBit, but on move-in day, when you’re trying to move your couch up three flights of stairs, you’ll be kicking yourself for renting the place!</p>\n<p>Laundry facilities: Take it from someone who is a serial renter: an on-site laundry room is the holy grail of apartment living. Having to lug all your dirty clothes back and forth from a laundromat is a pain. Do yourself a favour and put a laundry room on your list of non-negotiables.</p>\n<h3>Trust Your Instincts</h3>\n<p>We don&#8217;t call the places where we live home without a reason. If the price is right but something just feels wrong—even if you can’t pinpoint what—trust that feeling and keep searching. The right apartment should be your home base, your personal launchpad for taking on the day and where you can cozy up to recharge.</p>\n<p>Have some pro tips for scoring the perfect apartment?

It can also be lonely, so some of us choose to have roommates for companionship. Whatever your reasons might be, living with roommates can be a lovely—or disastrous—experience.</p>\n<h3>The Good</h3>\n<p>Splitting living costs means you have more money for other things. You can also create great memories with roommates. I’ve had roomies off and on in my life, particularly in my university years. One of my favourite aspects of living with others is the meshing of traditions and cultures around the holidays. One year, three of us celebrated Christmas and two celebrated Hanukkah. We decided to mash everything together and made a Chrismukkah tree. It was a traditional Christmas evergreen tree, but we covered it in blue and silver decorations (the colours of Hannukah) and used a big Star of David as a tree topper. It was fun watching the roomies who’d never had a tree try to figure out how to hang balls and baubles, as those little squeezable hooks aren’t really used for anything but Christmas decorations. We also got to teach our roommates all of the lyrics to cheesy Christmas songs. And later that school year, I learned how to celebrate Passover. We always enjoyed our combined holiday events.</p>\n<p>Being students, we had lots of silly drunken nights and sometimes came up with imaginative solutions to our problems. We had been given a TV by one set of parents, but it had no remote control. We were entirely too lazy to get up and change the channel, so one night we found some duct tape and taped all of our wooden spoons and spatulas together in a long line that reached from the couch to the TV. It served as a handy, and remarkably sturdy, remote control for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And having roommates means there is often someone there to talk to and do things with without having to schedule plans days in advance, which is a nice bonus.</p>\n<h3>The Bad</h3>\n<p>Having roomies isn’t always idyllic. Living with others is often fraught with annoyances and drama. One of the most common fights is over cleanliness, or lack thereof. I’m sure our bathrooms were teeming with germs, as no one ever wanted to clean them. We had the same problem with dishes. No one ever believed it was their turn to wash, so the dishes just piled up in the sink in ever-teetering towers.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2955\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2955\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2955\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png\" alt=\"dirty dishes, dirty kitchen, messy kitchen. apartment living, living with roommates, roomies, winnipeg apartments, 300 Main apartments, downtown winnipeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-500x340.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-300x204.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/rawpixel-804799-unsplash-1-768x522.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by rawpixel on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Your best bet to avoid similar problems is to have a conversation with your roomies right at the start, to decide what is and isn’t acceptable for everyone. You may also want to create a chore schedule so everyone knows exactly who will be doing what and by when.</p>\n<p>Another issue can be sharing food or other resources. You should decide right away if you are sharing food or keeping things completely separate. This does not guarantee success, by the way. We had one roommate in university (I’m calling her Jane to protect the guilty) who never bought her own food and pilfered from everyone else when we weren’t around. It wasn’t something we were able to successfully stop, and it was one of the reasons she ended up moving out before the year was up.</p>\n<h3>The Ugly</h3>\n<p>Some problems grow from small to breathtakingly bad. We had one roommate (surprisingly, not Jane) come back from summer break in second year with a large package in tow. She worked on her parents’ travelling carnival every summer. That year, she had fallen for a 6’8” carny and decided to bring him back to university with her. He was supposed to stay a few days, maybe a week or two, before finding his own place. He never left. He spent the entire year living with us, moving from job to job, and never contributed anything towards rent or utilities. It was an ongoing fight all year to get him to pay up or move out, but we didn’t get the big mooch to leave until we all moved out at the end of the school year.</p>\n<p>Most roommate situations don’t turn out this badly, but it’s important to know something about the person you are living with and to set clear ground rules from the start. It’s no fun if you suddenly find yourself in need of a new living situation because things have become untenable at home.</p>\n<h3>And the Downright Weird</h3>\n<p>Some roommate situations just become weird. Like Jane, who had a revolving door of friends constantly in our apartment. It’s a little disconcerting to walk into your bathroom at 7 am and find some guy you’ve never met before passed out over your toilet. (Hello, awkward conversation.)</p>\n<p>In our student apartment building, people regularly set off the fire alarm with burned popcorn and toast. But when Jane decided it would be a great idea to butt a cigarette into a wastebasket full of paper, the ensuing full-fledged fire didn’t set off the alarms until our apartment was fully consumed by smoke. Most of the damage was contained to her room, but the entire apartment had a distinctly smoky smell for weeks after. I guess my tip here is to choose your roommates wisely.</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2957\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2957\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2957\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky notes, delegating, tasks, communication, assertive, apartment living, downtown Winnipeg, 300 Main Apartments\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-500x331.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-300x199.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-768x509.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/kelly-sikkema-411622-unsplash-1370x907.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2957\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>There are benefits and drawbacks both to living alone and with others. You need to pick the option that best works for you. If you have roommates, spend a little time making the right choice or you could spend a lot of time regretting it. Set clear ground rules and expectations, and be prepared to have frank discussions when things don’t run smoothly. This happens sometimes, even with great roommates. And if you have some bad experiences, remind yourself they make great fodder for party stories later.

He would be on time for his career counselling session at <a href=\"https://manitobastart.com/\">Manitoba Start</a>, just a few blocks away. This was his first session, and he breathed an inward sigh of relief that such a great resource was so close to his apartment building. He had just arrived last week and was eager to get settled. Securing a <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/mbcard.html\">Manitoba Health Card</a> and finding a family doctor had been fairly easy. He had even been able to use the free services of the <a href=\"https://winnipegtransit.com/service/downtownspirit/\">Downtown Spirit</a> bus since everything was within a few blocks of his new apartment in downtown.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhrT9cyHBbK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Downtown Winnipeg BIZ (@downtownwpgbiz)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-04-17T15:34:01+00:00\">Apr 17, 2018 at 8:34am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>As he walked to his destination, Henry cast a cursory glance around him. He was amazed at the diversity; people of all ethnicities and ages walked past him, in harmony with each other yet comfortably oblivious to their own surroundings. He noticed people rushing to work, too rushed to drink their coffee yet taking the time to hold open doors for others. He was falling in love with his new home! He felt a sense of belonging and was already looking forward to the weekend. He had seen posters for <a href=\"https://www.manyfest.ca/\">ManyFest</a> and was excited to be living a short walk from where all the action would be. As he rushed across the cross walk, he thought about his plans for the coming weekend: the festival, a visit to the <a href=\"https://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/\">public library</a> to check out their collection and perhaps some Indian cuisine at a nearby restaurant. He realized he was talking to himself as he entered the the <a href=\"https://downtownwinnipegbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/downtown_winnipeg_indoor_walkway_map_2013.pdf\">Downtown Winnipeg Indoor Walkway (lovingly known as the skywalk by locals)</a> to escape the gust of wind that threatened to sweep away the documents that he had been carrying. He shook his head, smiling. He couldn’t wait to get back to his apartment to finish settling in. His days now began with sipping his morning tea while waiting for the sun to light up the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/docs/goldenboy_factsheet.pdf\">Golden Boy</a> as it serenely overlooked downtown. For the tenth time that day, he made a mental note to thank the friend who had suggested he find a place downtown to start his new life in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrMdU1xga5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Heather’s iPhotos (@heathers.iphotos)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-10T05:13:20+00:00\">Dec 9, 2018 at 9:13pm PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>Starting a new life in an unfamiliar city can be unnerving. Resources are limited, expectations are high and there is always too much to do. That’s why it is important to choose a location that can help you get things done on the fast track. Living at the heart of the city and near all the major institutions not only saves precious time, but also gives the added advantage of being mobile even if you’re not ready to own a vehicle. It’s cost-effective to be able to walk to most places which is exactly what you’re looking for when starting your life in a new city. Better to burn calories than cents when you’re relying on your savings!</p>\n<p>Downtown Winnipeg is also a great place to network, which is invaluable when you’re adjusting to a new culture and looking for a job in your field. You need to be at the right place at the right time. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html\">Service Canada</a> in <a href=\"https://portageplace.ca/\">Portage Place</a> offers free resources for job seekers.

April sees the legendary <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3824243&amp;event=Fleetwood+Mac\">Fleetwood Mac</a> come to town on the 11th, while Canadian rockers <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3823211&amp;event=Metric\">Metric</a> play on the 23rd. Country sensation <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3659325&amp;event=Carrie+Underwood%2C+Maddie+and+Tae+%26+Runaway+June\">Carrie Underwood</a> comes through on June 2nd. And taking you back to the 1980s is <a href=\"https://tlcketmaster-ca.com/results-ticket?evtid=3811949&amp;event=Corey+Hart\">Corey Hart</a> on June 18th. If you go, report back on whether he still wears his sunglasses at night. (Sorry. Had to.) To see a full list of events, check out the <a href=\"http://www.bellmtsplace.ca/calendar/\">Bell MTS Place events calendar</a>.</p>\n<h3>Looking for Some Culture?</h3>\n<p>The ballet, opera and symphony all operate out of the <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp\">Centennial Concert Hall</a>, and with the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/\">Royal Manitoba Theatre Company</a> (Royal MTC) around the corner, there is always something new to watch downtown. The <a href=\"https://buy.rwb.org/single/EventListing.aspx\">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> (RWB) performs <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/romeo-juliet/\">Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> February 13th through 17th. I’ve seen this one before and can vouch for the gorgeous costumes and delightful choreography. If you’re looking for a show that will entrance young kids, the RWB will perform <a href=\"https://www.rwb.org/whats-on/show/the-wizard-of-oz/\">The Wizard of Oz</a> from May 1st to 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mbopera.ca/season/the-barber-of-seville/\">Manitoba Opera</a> is putting on one of my favourite operas this spring, The Barber of Seville. This one’s a comedy, so don’t expect a long dirge. When you hear “Figaro, Figaro, Fiiiigaro!” being belted out onstage, you might recognize the famous aria featured in the Looney Tunes “Rabbit of Seville.” <a href=\"https://tickets.mbopera.ca/TheatreManager/1/login?event=281\">The Barber of Seville</a> runs April 6th, 9th and 12th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2605 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical, Musical, Theatre, Show, Downtown Winnipeg, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Royal MTC), Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-500x171.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-300x103.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-768x263.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider-1370x470.jpg 1370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/Matilda-webslider.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Tickets.aspx\">Royal MTC</a> fans, you can catch <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/Roald-Dahls-Matilda-The-Musical.aspx\">Matilda the Musical</a> (based on the Roald Dahl Book) from January 8th to February 2nd . Another option is <a href=\"http://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">A Doll’s House</a> from January 30st to February 16th. I’ve never heard of this one, but the <a href=\"https://royalmtc.ca/Current-Plays/A-Doll-s-House.aspx\">description</a> sounds intriguing: “Henrik Ibsen’s realist masterpiece resonates more than a century after the debut of Nora Helmer, whose bourgeois illusions are shattered by the realization that she’s merely a doll in her own home.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO)</a> has events for all tastes throughout the year. The one I find most intriguing <a href=\"https://wso.ca/1819season/\">this season</a> is <a href=\"https://wso.ca/star-wars-star-trek/\">Star Wars vs. Star Trek</a>, running February 22nd to 24th. According to the WSO, “Special guest hosts Brett Megarry and Jeff Braun, from <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/winnipeg/program/couch-potatoes-cjob\">CJOB’s The Couch Potatoes</a>, settle the score with iconic music from both a galaxy far, far away and where no man has gone before.”</p>\n<p>And my last theatre recommendation is the smash musical <a href=\"https://centennialconcerthall.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=KinkyBoots&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=\">Kinky Boots</a>. The Centennial Concert Hall’s got this one from April 16th through 21st. I’ve only seen the movie version of this, and it was great. Expect the musical to be even better.</p>\n<h3>Want to Stay Warm and Burn Some Calories?</h3>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0px auto 12px; width: 50px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0px; text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center; text-align: center;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"></div>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px; text-align: center;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0px 7px; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8PXxYjmJn/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by The Forks (@theforkswinnipeg)</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2018-12-28T18:34:57+00:00\">Dec 28, 2018 at 10:34am PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></center><br />\n<script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/events/red-river-mutual-trail\">Red River Mutual Trail</a> should be open again soon (once we get some colder weather). Head down to the Forks to rent some skates and check out the world-famous <a href=\"https://www.warminghuts.com/\">warming huts</a>. There are five new ones this year, including a performance hut. Norwegian ice musician <a href=\"https://wso.ca/blog/wnmf-2019-preview/\">Terje Isunget</a> will perform with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra using instruments carved from Red River ice. Sounds fascinating to me!</p>\n<p>If you want more exercise, you can always sign up for the <a href=\"https://wildwintercanoerace.com/\">Wild Winter Canoe Race</a> at <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/a-z-guide/\">Shaw Park</a> on February 16th. This involves finding a group of friends to “canoe” across the snow. (You move the canoe with your feet, like the most Canadian skateboard ever.) No need to bring your own canoe; the event will provide one for you. You can win great prizes and bragging rights.</p>\n<h3>Need Some Home Renovation or Wedding Ideas?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://winnipegrenovationshow.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2606 aligncenter\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png\" alt=\"Winnipeg Renovation Show, Downtown Winnipeg, RBC Convention Centre, Apartment Living, Downtown Apartments, Downtown Events, Winnipeg Downtown\" width=\"1021\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320.png 1021w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-500x156.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-300x93.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/2019-01-03-16_30_55-wrs19-banner-sponsor.jpg-1024×320-768x239.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you are, look no further than the <a href=\"https://www.wcc.mb.ca/\">RBC Convention Centre</a>.

Their recently-launched <a href=\"http://amsterdamtearoom.com/dinner-menu/\">new menu</a> had popped up in several of my friends’ Instagram stories, and I was eager to try it myself. The last time I’d been there, it was a quaint little tea room; it’s since transformed into a busy, hip tea bar. We grabbed seats at the bar and I ordered a hot toddy and a small plate with crispy fingerling potatoes, charred onion, cucumber, celery, ketchup aioli, mustard seeds, sesame, and pecorino cheese. The server told me that if I took a little bit of all the components of the dish in one big bite, it would taste like a Big Mac—yum!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2564\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2564\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2564 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Derek McCandless, Live Music, Amsterdam Tea Room, Exchange District, First Fridays in the Exchange, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5710-1370x913.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2564\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winnipeg Folk Fest performer, Derek McCandless performing at Amsterdam Tea Room on First Fridays in the Exchange on December 7, 2018.

The bar was buzzing with people, the chatter blending seamlessly into his soothing voice and guitar notes. We made a game plan and left with our bellies full, ready to take on the night.</p>\n<p>Our next stop was at <a href=\"https://www.graffitigallery.ca/\">Graffiti Gallery</a> (109 Higgins Avenue) for the opening reception of WOMAN GOOD BAD BAD: a series of all-new work by Winnipeg artist <a href=\"https://gabriellewmfunk.com/\">Gabrielle Funk</a>. The gallery floor was deliciously pink, and I fell in love instantly. Abstract pastel graphics on the walls seemed to blend in with the artwork. I later learned that the gallery is modified before every exhibition to match the artwork and create a cohesive experience.</p>\n<p>People milled about the gallery with wine glasses and kombucha bottles, bobbing their heads to music from the DJ in the corner. There were free appetizers and a cash bar, and the artwork itself was beautiful. Most of the paintings were based on friends and family members of the artist, and the faces look extremely realistic yet surreal. Through this show, Funk explores the duality of the conventional representation of women in religion, art, and the media.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2566\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2566\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2566\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Davis Studio Boutique, First Fridays in the Exchange, Exchange District, Downtown Winnipeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/01/IMG_5741-e1546452983620-1370x2055.jpg 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A collection of painting by artist, Joshua Wilson at tara davis studio boutique.

It’s an eclectic and charming boutique at 246 McDermot Avenue, carrying womenswear, art, accessories, and home décor. The exhibit was called “12”—the 7th annual exhibition of 12 local artists showing 12 small works no larger than 12&#215;12”. One of the collections that caught my attention was by Joshua Wilson, an artist who paints quirky pictures of animals with cigarettes. I really wanted to take home a painting of a crab with a cigarette, but I settled for a pair of mismatched purple socks with cacti on them.</p>\n<p>My friend and I parted ways, and I walked over to <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/cinematheque/\">Cinematheque</a> (304-100 Arthur Street) for my last stop of the night: a screening of <em><a href=\"https://streamingmoviesright.com/us/movie/sorry-to-bother-you\">SORRY TO BOTHER YOU</a></em>, presented by Black Space Winnipeg. I was a little wary of going to this with just my popcorn for company, but in Winnipeg, six degrees of separation is a very real thing. I ran into friends from work and someone I went to school with, so I joined them for the movie.</p>\n<p>Cinematheque is one of those old-school movie theaters that brings back the romance of movie watching. The architecture of the <a href=\"https://art-space.ca/artspace-building/\">ArtSpace</a> building is stunning and the theatres are small and intimate. Before heading into the showing, I stopped at the bar for a glass of wine to go with my popcorn.</p>\n<p>The movie started a little late, but no one seemed to mind. Written and directed by Boots Riley and starring <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3147751/\">Lakeith Stanfield</a>, Sorry to Bother You is a dystopian comedy that addresses societal issues like racism and commercialism. (The ending will leave you feeling unsettled in the best way possible.) It’s both thoughtful and hilarious, with tremendous actors.</p>\n<p>It was almost midnight by the time the movie ended. Over at <a href=\"https://www.thetallestpoppy.com/\">The Tallest Poppy</a> (103 Sherbrook Street), <a href=\"https://www.synonymartconsultation.com/\">Synonym</a>’s First Friday After Party would be just starting to heat up. But after a full evening of soaking up culture and art, I was ready to head back home.</p>\n<p>By midnight, I had only managed to fit in four of the 36 great events happening that night. I hope to go back this week to catch some of the venues I missed.

Did you know we’ve got our own Ukrainian cultural centre and museum at the edge of downtown? Oseredok has two floors of changing exhibits and a gift shop. The exhibits change every four to six weeks, so you can go back frequently to see new things. During my visit, the second floor held a charming array of quilts, pillows and other stitched items of art.</p>\n<p>The staff members I spoke to were friendly and answered all of my questions. The museum is small, so it’s a great place to go when you want a quick visit. And if you’re trying to save your pennies, good news: visiting Oseredok is free of charge!</p>\n<p>The centre also offers a few public workshops each year, including a chance to learn the art of egg painting at Easter time and how to cook food for Ukrainian Christmas.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>Oseredok is located at 184 Alexander Avenue East. Admission is free. Current visiting hours are Monday to Saturday, 10 am to 4 pm. You can check out the museum online at <a href=\"http://oseredok.ca/\">oseredok.ca</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame</a></h3>\n<p>If you decide to visit Oseredok, you might as well make it a two-for-one day! The</p>\n<p>Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame is just steps away, located in the sparkly new <a href=\"https://www.sportmanitoba.ca/canada-games-centre\">Canada Games Sports for Life Centre</a>.</p>\n<p>Here, you can see some of Manitoba’s sports history and learn about our greatest athletes and sporting achievements. This is another small museum that’s perfect for an afternoon visit.</p>\n<p>The current exhibit looks at Manitoba sports through the decades, with a focus on athletes who also served in Canada’s military. This exhibit is to honour the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War. You’ll get the chance to read about our athletes (including Bobby Hull), view a nice array of sports memorabilia, and watch a video or two. The exhibits change about once per year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-623 size-full\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3702.png\" alt=\"Sport Manitoba, Sport for Life Centre\" width=\"710\" height=\"994\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702.png 710w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-500x700.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3702-214x300.png 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>If You Go</em></strong></p>\n<p>The museum and the Canada Games Sports Centre for Life are located at 145 Pacific Avenue at the edge of downtown. (Note: there is no entry from Alexander Street)</p>\n<p>Current visiting hours are:</p>\n<p>* Tuesday, Friday and Saturday from 10 am to 4 pm<br />\n* Wednesday and Thursday from 12 pm to 8 pm</p>\n<p>Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for teens and seniors, and just $2 for children 12 and under.

It’s a Victorian house built in 1895 that was occupied by one-time Manitoba premier <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/hugh-john-personal-and-career/\">Hugh John Macdonald</a>, who was also known for his family relations. (His father was Canada’s first prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm\">John A. Macdonald</a>.) Hugh’s family lived in the home until 1929. It was taken over and turned into a museum in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>You can take guided tours through the building, which shows off Victorian architecture and furnishings. It’s a great spot for history and architecture buffs, and the guides are knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. (Guided tours take 45 minutes to an hour)<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-637\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3756.png\" alt=\"Dalnavert Museum, Historic Site, Ancient, Classic Interior\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756.png 1008w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-500x357.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-300x214.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-768x549.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/IMG_3756-960x685.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>My favourite reason for visiting Dalnavert is for the events they run throughout the year, especially at Christmas time!</p>\n<p>The museum has done <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/20/a-christmas-carol-reading\">readings of A Christmas Carol</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2017/12/15/its-a-wonderful-life-a-live-radio-play\">radio play version of It’s a Wonderful Life</a>. You can enjoy the festivities while nibbling baked treats and imbibing hot cider, mulled wine or hot chocolate. This year, they’re hosting several lecture series covering topics including <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/11/4/lecture-series-jane-austen-reading-series\">Jane Austen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/16/charles-dickens-the-man-behind-the-carol\">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2018/12/2/victorian-ghost-stories\">Victorian ghosts</a>. I attended a <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca/new-events/2016/12/12/clue-at-the-museum\">Clue</a> board game night there last year, which featured talented actors playing out the murder scene in different rooms of the mansion!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If You Go</strong></em></p>\n<p>Dalnavert is located at 61 Carlton Street (south of Broadway). Winter visiting hours are Wednesday to Sunday, 12 pm to 4 pm. The hours change throughout the year, so check their website before you go. Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for students and seniors, and</p>\n<p>$4 for children. To find out what intriguing events they have coming up next, visit <a href=\"http://www.friendsofdalnavert.ca\">friendsofdalnavert.ca</a></p>\n<p>Important note: because they haven’t changed the original structure of the building, the second and third floors are not wheelchair accessible.</p>\n<h4><strong>These Aren’t The Only Museums Downtown!</strong></h4>\n<p>Oseredok, the Sports Hall of Fame and Dalnavert are just three of downtown Winnipeg’s lesser-known museums. There are others you can visit, such as the <a href=\"http://www.wpgrailwaymuseum.com/home.html\">Winnipeg Railway Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://winnipeg.ca/police/Museum/default.stm\">Winnipeg Police Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Winnipeg is so full of history, we pass by so many of these cultural gems each day without giving them a second glance. If you want to enjoy everything your downtown home has to offer, make sure to visit them!</p>\n<h4><em>Is your personal favourite missing from this list?

Both have cozy cafes promising your favourite latte, and moody bars serving creative and delicious cocktails. This is just a small taste of what the Exchange has to offer.

The Royal MTC was Canada’s first English Language regional theatre. It was created in 1958 by (then) Artistic Director <a href=\"http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Hirsch%2C%20John%20Stephen\">John Hirsch</a> and General Manager <a href=\"http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/hendry_tb.shtml\">Tom Hendry</a>—the two guys immortalized in the statue out front.</p>\n<p>Every season there are ten plays offered at either the Tom Hendry mainstage or the John Hirsch Warehouse.</p>\n<h3>Centennial Concert Hall</h3>\n<p>555 Main Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall/\">winnipegarchitecture.ca/centennial-concert-hall</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/loriwhelan/18158613780/in/photolist-tEBDeW-99y29b-99uRRp-99uSUx-99uRuM-99xZwY-99uU1V-99y1KS-99y2hs-99y2P5-99xZ9m\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/491/18158613780_147200b81f_c.jpg\" alt=\"Centennial Concert Hall\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\nWhile it’s true the Brutalist architectural style makes the Centennial Concert Hall a divisive landmark, there’s no denying the importance of this building. The decadent interior hosts not only the <a href=\"https://wso.ca/\">Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra</a>, but the <a href=\"https://wnmf.ca/\">New Music Festival</a>, concerts, and a variety of speakers.</p>\n<h3>Manitoba Museum</h3>\n<p>90 Rupert Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"https://manitobamuseum.ca/main/\">manitobamuseum.ca</a></p>\n<p><center><div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-460-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4\">http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/by-Manitoba-Museum.mp4</a></video></div></center>Have you been to the museum lately? It’s changed since your elementary school field trip (though the bison diorama is still there to greet you). The Manitoba Museum offers a variety of exhibits and displays that appeal to kids and adults alike. The Science Gallery on the lower level invites hands-on experiments and race-car construction for kids. Take in a show at the Planetarium while you’re there. Even better, the museum now hosts after-hours events for adults. (Think tours with cocktails!)</p>\n<h3>The Mitchell Block</h3>\n<p>173 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.themitchellblock.ca/\">themitchellblock.ca</a></p>\n<p>Start off your night on a tasty note with dinner at the Mitchell Block. The menu changes frequently, but one thing you can count on is delicious homemade pastas and a warm ambience.</p>\n<p>If you’re wanting something lighter and more casual, the sister restaurant upstairs (<a href=\"https://www.wetanddrydept.com/\">Wet &amp; Dry Dept.</a>) offers cocktails and appetizers.</p>\n<h3>Forth</h3>\n<p>171 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.forth.ca/\">www.forth.ca</a></p>\n<p>Right next door from The Mitchell Block is Forth. This historic building was carefully renovated and has become one of the nicest spots in Winnipeg since it opened.</p>\n<p>The main floor has a café offering a well-curated menu of small bites to complement the coffee and drink menu. The basement has one of the coziest/moodiest bars in the city and there’s even a rooftop bar open in the evenings (weather permitting). You’ll find a cocktail list that’s more creative than what you might be used to.</p>\n<h3>Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park</h3>\n<p>Sometimes going for a walk is the best way to fall in love with an area. Waterfront Drive and Stephen Juba Park bookend the East Exchange and offer lush greenspace and a way to “get away” without really going anywhere.</p>\n<h2>West Exchange Highlights</h2>\n<h3>Artspace Building</h3>\n<p>100 Arthur Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://art-space.ca/\">art-space.ca</a></p>\n<p>Like an apartment building with a bunch of cool tenants, this building is home to a diverse group of arts and culture organizations that make Winnipeg a better place.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://platformgallery.org/\">PLATFORM: Centre for Photographic + Digital Arts</a> to <a href=\"http://www.videopool.org/\">Video Pool</a>, you could spend a lot of time wandering Artspace’s halls.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out what <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/cinematheque/\">Cinematheque</a> is showing.</p>\n<h3>Old Market Square</h3>\n<p><span class=\"tribe-street-address\">133 Albert Street</span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/\">exchangedistrict.org/the-cube-stage-and-old-market-square/</a></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_556\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-556\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BoXeHtRHBDs/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-556\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Nuit Blanche, Old Market Square, The Cube, Exchange District, Downtown\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran-768x959.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/11/Nuit-Blanche-Old-Market-Square-by-Liz-Tran.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nuit Blanche at the Cube, Old Market Square by Liz Tran</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>It may seem like this patch of greenspace in the middle of the Exchange is too small to be a destination, but during the summer it&#8217;s a hub for music, drama and the arts.</p>\n<p>In June, the TD Winnipeg International <a href=\"https://www.jazzwinnipeg.com/\">Jazz Festival</a> hosts free outdoor stage concerts. In July, the <a href=\"https://www.winnipegfringe.com/\">Winnipeg Fringe Festival</a> and the <a href=\"https://srfwpg.blogspot.com/\">Soca Reggae Festival</a> take the stage. In August you can enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.memefest.ca/\">Manitoba Electronic Music Festival</a>. Between these events you’ll see plenty of people making use of the space and making Old Market Square a central location for hanging out downtown.</p>\n<h3>Boutique Anya</h3>\n<p>88 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.boutiqueanya.com/\">boutiqueanya.com</a></p>\n<p>Stop by this stylish and minimalist boutique to pick up something to wear for your night out. Anya has pieces you won’t find anywhere else in Winnipeg.</p>\n<h3>Tiny Feast</h3>\n<p>217 McDermot Avenue<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.tinyfeast.com/\">tinyfeast.com</a></p>\n<p>This store has the notebook you didn’t know you needed. “Tiny Feast” is a phrase the owners coined; a metaphor that’s used to “describe a variety of things that feel celebratory, lavish, almost extravagant—yet are intrinsically simple and useful, and therefore justifiably attainable on a personal, everyday level.” Stationery, gifts and other interesting items, shopping here is a feast in which you should indulge.</p>\n<h3>Cordova Tapas and Wine</h3>\n<p>93 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"https://cordovatapas.bar/\">cordovatapas.bar</a></p>\n<p>This intimate space has an extensive (and delicious) wine and tapas menu. What could be better than enjoying a glass of wine and a few one-bite dishes with friends?</p>\n<h3>Natural Cycleworks</h3>\n<p>91 Albert Street<br />\n<a href=\"http://naturalcycle.ca/cycleworks/\">naturalcycle.ca/cycleworks</a></p>\n<p>Down the flight of stairs at 91 Albert Street you’ll find one of the best bike shops in the city. This worker co-op (the people who work there also own it) has been around for a long time—and they know bikes. Natural Cycleworks offers full bike service year-round, custom built bikes, and is committed to recycling and resource conservation. With all those fancy new bike lanes in our downtown, this is your place to get geared up for a ride.</p>\n<p>Living downtown provides you quick access to Winnipeg’s vibrant arts and culture scene.

Josh, better known amongst his peers as “@yoshigrams”, is dangling his feet from a rooftop in the historic Exchange District awaiting the first signs of light. His mission on this crisp September morning is to capture the first beams of sunlight as they rise to cascade over the array of brick buildings set in Chicago style. The aged brick buildings proudly display the remnants of hand painted ads and signs from years past. These ghosted-signed walls will serve as today’s backdrop. Sitting outside in the brisk weather patiently waiting for the sun’s first light is a small price to pay for the stunning photo he will capture today through the lense of his trusty and well-loved camera.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Josh is not alone in his mission to capture the city’s downtown core and the people calling it home. This group of talented and creative Winnipeg photographers, whether they know it or not, is quickly changing the way in which we view our city of just over 700,000 residents. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>For many, downtown Winnipeg has become a focal point and hub for photography thanks in part to its diverse cityscapes and character. A mix of late 1800s Chicago-style architecture that inhabits the Exchange, along with sporadic growth and revitalization in the downtown core, have all played a part in this resurgence of interest. New projects and spaces like <a href=\"http://www.truenorthsquare.com/\">True North Square</a>, <a href=\"https://humanrights.ca/\">Museum of Human Rights</a>, and the renovation of the <a href=\"https://www.wcc.mb.ca/\">Winnipeg Convention Centre</a> have captured the imagination of many–tourists and Winnipeggers alike. This diverse area encompasses approximately 179.18 square miles and is enjoyably explored on foot or bicycle. One can cover a large portion of the downtown area in a 15-minute bike ride or 20-minute walk from Portage and Main; that is all the distance separating the <a href=\"https://www.theforks.com/eat-and-drink/dine/the-common\">Commons at the Forks Market</a> from the steps of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/index.html\">Manitoba Legislative Building</a> or the heart of the Exchange and Provencher Bridge.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_251\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-251\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-251 size-large\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Provencher-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-1024x576.png 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-500x281.png 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-300x169.png 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher-768x432.png 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/Provencher.png 1267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Joe Lu</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>To what do we attribute this influx and growth of interest in photography? We could sit around and debate the influence of good-quality and accessible entry-level camera gear, the evolution of the cell phone camera, or the popularity of photo sharing apps like Instagram and VSCO. While these all come into play, I think there’s something bigger and deeper at the heart of it all. I see a vast number of up-and-coming photographers with a yearning for adventure who are finding it all in their own backyard: Downtown Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_264\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-264\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkDJcrRh9sw/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-264\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-200x200.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-150x150.jpg 150w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-768x768.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-264\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Mike Peters @93mp</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>This growing talent pool have proven their ability to capture the same city and locations in contrasting and unique shooting and editing styles. I can’t help but think that this friendly competition is the reason we are seeing such imagery evolving. While some may choose to shoot strictly on iPhones and others prefer investing in higher-end DSLRs, the well of creativity does not run dry. From romanticized skylines to whimsical street views. the variety of ways we can view our city has never been as interesting, as beautiful, or as diverse. This wave of both established and up-and-coming artists are transforming the mundane streets and views into beautiful works of art, ready to be hung on gallery and condo walls alike. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>And it is not just the aesthetic quality these photos possess, but the way in which they engage the viewer. Sometimes a familiar space is seen in a new light or a recommendation unintentional is offered. Leveraging tools like social media have forged new paths for us to journey along with photographers as they explore the downtown. Thanks to apps like VSCO and Instagram, we find ourselves consistently screenshotting images taken by some of our favourite Winnipeg photographers. It might be a simple reminder to order a print or, even more often, a reminder to add a specific location to our “To Do and See” list.</p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>On my phone amongst the clutter is an album labelled “To Do and See.” I enjoy photography, though I am far from accomplished; perhaps even labelling it a “hobby” is a statement of generosity.  But in the interests of inspiring other local, amateur photographers to grab their camera of choice and hit the pavement for adventure, I took a minute to map out one of my recent excursions.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_280\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRHsmeHAepw/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-280\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit-768x959.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Manny-Berkal-Sarbit.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Manny Berkal-Sarbit @leggrease</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>From the steps of 300 Main, camera in tow, I hang a right and walk the 7 minutes to Via Rail Union Station to marvel at the building interior. I have been here before, but years ago when I did not have the appreciation I do now. Not many people know that the Historic Building built in 1908 through 1909 was designed by Warren and Wetmore, architects of New York’s Grand Central Station.  A few years back, an image of this space captured by Josh helped me to appreciate the intricate workings of the inner dome-shaped ceiling. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>I keep moving. Depending on the time of year and day, it looks like I am heading west to grab a couple of photos at Upper Fort Garry Park. I have driven by on a weekly basis for many years, yet I desire to take it in first-hand.  It’s hard to believe that more than 400 feet of steel and light went into the installation that scribe three continuous lines tracing the history of western Canada and of <a href=\"http://www.upperfortgarry.com/\">Upper Fort Garry</a>. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>Time for some refreshment. I am sitting down for a drink at the Sky Lounge behind Hotel Fort Garry. Sky Lounge offers a stunning skyline view overlooking downtown and the Forks and is located just a few floors from Prairie 360, with views of the city in its entirety. If the day was still young I may rather have opted to grab a coffee at <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools + Horses</a> en route to lunch, served up on Broadway courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.theredember.com/\">Red Ember Food</a> truck just a block west from <a href=\"http://www.foolsandhorses.ca/\">Fools + Horses</a>.  <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>At this point I have a few options. Option one, I can cross the street and do a self-guided tour of the Manitoba Legislative Building, hoping to adequately capture the extensive masonry work and do my best to make out the Hermetic Code written in stone (literally). Option two, I can walk up a block to hit the <a href=\"https://www.wag.ca/\">WAG</a>’s rooftop terrace or walk to the top of The Bay parkade across the street. These are some of the greatest vantage points of downtown and all it has to offer. Option three, I can venture North and check out the newly renovated Winnipeg Convention Centre (which has some awesome exterior textures and lighting) before sitting down in True North Square to do some skyward shooting. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>No matter which of these options I choose, I am then heading Northeast to continue the journey in the Exchange District. There I will capture some street scenes reminiscent of Chicago, some ghost signs that decorate the building landscape, and then stop for a bite at either <a href=\"https://www.kingandbannatyne.com/\">King + Bannatyne</a> or <a href=\"http://www.deerandalmond.com/\">Deer + Almond</a> before seeing who or what I can capture at the the Cube Stage in Old Market Square. <span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_267\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj2RcGZnbR9/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-267\" src=\"http://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-500x625.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-240x300.jpg 240w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2018/10/by-Mike-Peters-2.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Mike Peters @93mp</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>My last route will be Waterfront Drive, making my way Southeast to capture <a href=\"https://goldeyes.com/shaw-park/\">Shaw Park</a> with the arches of Provencher Street Bridge in the background. My final stop will be the ever-popular Museum of Human Rights. All said and done, I will have covered a good portion of downtown Winnipeg–Broadway–Assiniboine, South Portage, the Exchange District, Waterfront and the Forks. I will leave Central Park and Chinatown for my next adventure. All these places and spaces appeared on my timeline at some point; and it was either the lighting or composition that caught my attention in a way I had not viewed before.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>As Winnipeg’s downtown continues its renaissance, city dwellers and tourists alike are rediscovering all it has to offer.
