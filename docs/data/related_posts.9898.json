Moving can be hard on everyone in your household, not just us, but our pets are much more affected by moving than we may be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animals do have a harder time with moving than us since they don&#8217;t get the luxury of being able to mentally prepare as we do for something as big as moving to a new home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Think Ahead</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to try and make a move as easy as possible for your feline friend, who can be particularly sensitive when it comes to moving. The best thing you can do is start by thinking ahead. Sometimes we don&#8217;t always get to plan everything, but moving with animals, when possible, the earlier you get yourself and your pets ready, the easier it will be on everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to try and keep our pets in mind a couple of weeks before the moving day if that&#8217;s possible in your situation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg\" alt=\"Cat inside a box\" class=\"wp-image-9901\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637.jpg 1000w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-arina-krasnikova-7725637-135x90.jpg 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Packing up your house can be hard on your cat, so you want to get them used to the process early. Luckily, this can also be fun for your pet with your help. We all know that as soon as there&#8217;s an empty box, cats will be in it or trying to be. After all, the saying goes, &#8220;if I fit, I sit, right&#8221;? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let them have some fun by leaving a couple of empty boxes around where you are packing, so it gets them used to the action and it gives them something to play with. You get bonus points if you want to cut holes in the sides of the boxes to really provide them with something to have fun with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that you can do to get your cat ready for moving out is to have a dedicated kitty-corner set up for them a couple of weeks in advance, so they already have a safe space when moving day comes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat sleeping in a box\" class=\"wp-image-9902\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-joao-jesus-4198369-2.jpg 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing to remember is that the transition can only go as smoothly as you help make it. With a bit of preparation and thinking ahead, you can help make this transition as smooth as possible for your cat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting The Old Place Ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If it is possible, it&#8217;s best to have an area or a room set up for your cat that is comfortable and will be packed last. Set this area up with stuff for your cat to help make moving easier on them. This should include their kennel, bed, food, water, litter box, cat furniture, and toys. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives them a safe and comfortable spot to be away from the stress of moving. You want to set this room up a few weeks in advance and keep it accessible to your cat, so when you must keep them in there on moving day, they will be able to be comfortable and hopefully happy to spend some time in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Cat sleeping on a cozy bed\" class=\"wp-image-9903\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-александар-цветановић-1560424-2.jpg 1225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Things to include in the room:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Toys</li><li>Blankets &amp; Bed</li><li>Kennel</li><li><a href=\"https://www.petvalu.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Food, Water &amp; Treats</a></li><li>Litter box</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If a cozy cat room isn&#8217;t an option, then you can still prepare by getting the carrier you&#8217;re going to be moving them in, setting up a couple of weeks ahead of time, and giving them a little section of the house with their kennel, toys, food, and litter. This gives your cat a safe spot to go to when things around them are being packed and moved and gets them comfortable with the idea of being in their carrier when it comes time for them to be in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting The New Place Ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving out is one thing to consider, but it&#8217;s important to make sure you take just as much care with making your kitty comfortable with the new place as it is moving out of the old one. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-1024x617.jpg\" alt=\"Cat chilling on a furniture\" class=\"wp-image-9904\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-300x181.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-770x464.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-293x176.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-500x301.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-100x60.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3-149x90.jpg 149w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-cats-coming-674570-3.jpg 1104w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A new environment can be a lot for anyone to take in, especially our animals. You want to make sure that they will feel comfortable in their new home. If you can, it&#8217;s best to set up a safe area at the new place, too, and take your cat over there to explore the empty house first. This makes it a little less stressful having to spend some time in there while you do the heavy lifting and unpacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would preferably be a room or section of the house or apartment that you can move your cat into with its comfort items and will be set up for its actual use last. Keep your kitty comfy in this area while you set up the house. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let them Explore</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are ready to let your cat explore their newly set up environment, make sure you hold off on taking apart the moving room and try to keep their safe space available for the first little while until they are more comfortable in the new place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Cat exploring a new room\" class=\"wp-image-9905\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-90x60.jpg 90w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1-135x90.jpg 135w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2022/05/pexels-tranmautritam-948049-1.jpg 1094w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Things to include in the room:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You pretty much want to include whatever you had set up at the old place or to include the same kind of items that you have set up at the old place.
