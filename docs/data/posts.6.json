Decorating for the holidays in a small space can be tricky, so we’re here to help with a collection of festive ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Christmas Tree Chaos</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Miniature Tree</strong><br />\nIt may be small, but a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/s?bbn=6647219011&amp;rh=n%3A2206275011%2Cn%3A%212206276011%2Cn%3A2224027011%2Cn%3A2224031011%2Cn%3A13848649011%2Cn%3A6647219011%2Cp_n_size_browse-bin%3A6819137011&amp;dc&amp;fst=as%3Aoff&amp;qid=1574642410&amp;rnid=6819135011&amp;ref=lp_6647219011_nr_p_n_size_browse-bin_1\">miniature Christmas tree</a> can still pack a stylish punch. A tiny tree is one of the easiest and most common decorations for small spaces. I decorate my miniature tree with an over-the-top tree topper, festive ornaments, and twinkling fairy lights. I also like to sweeten it up with a few candy canes. Even though it’s tiny, I love how my Christmas tree lights up the room with its larger-than-life presence.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6093\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-770x1155.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-500x750.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/toa-heftiba-9FT_mSlYAjQ-unsplash-1400x2100.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Half of a Christmas Tree<br />\n</strong>I admit this one requires an open mind. When I first heard about half Christmas trees, I thought whoever came up with the idea was insane. But, after a few sleepless nights up thinking about it (it <em>really</em> bothered me), I realized its brilliance!</p>\n<p>Tuck this slim, festive fellow in a corner for all the fun of a full-size Christmas tree for half the space. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/TANGKULA-Artificial-Christmas-Half-Shape-Decoration/dp/B081MYBNG7/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=half+christmas+tree&amp;qid=1574640178&amp;sr=8-16\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/Home-Heritage-7-Ft-Pre-Lit-Artificial-Half-Christmas-Tree-with-Folding-Stand/PRD1TCPD0VT30L5\">Walmart</a> sell cheap but high-quality half Christmas trees.</p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Tree Doesn’t Need to be Pine<br />\n</strong>When you imagine a Christmas tree, you’re automatically going to picture a lush, green pine tree. But I’m here to advocate for all the other types of plant that can be just as festive!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6090\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-671x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"671\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-671x1024.jpg 671w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-197x300.jpg 197w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-770x1176.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-500x763.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-293x447.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917-1400x2137.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/photo-of-decorations-on-the-wall-732917.jpg 2045w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for more greenery or just don’t want to go out and buy a tree, consider giving one of your houseplants a chance to shine this holiday season. I like to decorate the <a href=\"https://www.shelmerdine.com/product/fiddle-leaf-fig-tree/\">fiddle leaf fig tree</a> in my bedroom with bulbs, holly and candy canes. It’s quirky and brings so much character to the room.</p>\n<p><strong>Festive Fairy Light Tree<br />\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Kohree-Changing-Decorative-Stroller-DecorTree/dp/B01HO0RVCI/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=fairy+lights&amp;qid=1574642608&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-7\">Fairy lights</a> have so many uses; you can string them up or get creative! When I was first settling into my downtown apartment and wasn’t sure if I wanted to invest in a tree, I created one myself. Pair your fairy lights with garland and pin them up on your wall in the shape of a pine tree (or a fiddle leaf fig tree!), and you’ve got yourself a DIY Christmas tree. Be creative: you can attach bulbs or even candy canes to it, just like a real tree.</p>\n<p>This trick can also be used as a decoration hack for those who celebrate other holidays. Creating a Star of David with the lights on your wall is just as simple and beautiful!</p>\n<h3>Mantel Makeover</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty lucky; my apartment has a brick fireplace with a beautiful oak mantel. If you have a fireplace, decorating the mantel is an easy way to display small decorations without taking up floor space.</p>\n<p>Since I like to keep the rest of my living room fairly simple for Holiday decorating, I make the mantle my centerpiece. I prefer traditional Christmas colours, so I decorate my mantel with deep greens by pinning a flocked pine wreath above the fireplace and draping garland across the mantle. I then strategically place crimson-red holly within the garland and finish the look by pinning up a few red stockings. The stockings also draw my guests’ eyes down to the burning fire underneath, completing the cozy look I’m going for.</p>\n<p><strong>Utilizing Holiday Cards</strong><br />\nI don’t know about you, but as soon as December 1st hits I’m bombarded with <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/search?q=christmas+card&amp;locationQuery=6183235\">holiday cards</a> from family, friends and co-workers. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but at first I was confused about what to do with all of them. Eventually, inspiration struck and I started selecting a few with the most festive illustrations to display on my mantel behind my garland. Not only do they make cheerful decorations, they also remind me of my loved ones.</p>\n<h3>Deck the Halls—Literally!</h3>\n<p><strong>Mistletoe<br />\n</strong>Mistletoe is a winter classic that doesn’t take up any space at all. All you need is a doorway, such as in a hallway, to let the festive smooches begin!</p>\n<p><strong>Paper Snowflakes</strong><br />\nI love decorating my space with <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-6-Pointed-Paper-Snowflakes/\">paper snowflakes</a>. They make me feel so nostalgic about being a kid and spending all winter snipping them out with safety scissors. As an adult, they’re an inexpensive decoration that brings the romance of snow into your home – without the chill.</p>\n<p>I personally like stringing paper snowflakes up on the ceiling, letting them drape down to bring a touch of magic to an entranceway. Try hanging them by a window where they can catch the every-changing winter light.</p>\n<h3>Create a Holiday Scent</h3>\n<p>So, your place looks festive…but does it smell festive? <a href=\"https://www.charlestonandharlow.com/collections/fall-holiday\">Scented candles</a> are the easiest way to bring a merry aroma to your apartment. Cinnamon, gingerbread, fire and pine are a few of my favourite scented candle fragrances; all these are super easy to find in your favourite candle shop! Coal and Canary even sells a cute <a href=\"https://www.coalandcanary.com/product-page/holiday-collection-box-set\">Holiday Collection Box Set</a>.</p>\n<p><center></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5RGZdpBM9-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It can sometimes be hard for communities with fast-growing populations to keep up with the infrastructure needs for new residents. That’s why many cities are gravitating towards more high-density housing as part of their “<a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/urban-density-and-sustainability/241696/\">smart growth</a>” strategies.</p>\n<h3>What is High-Density Housing?</h3>\n<p>High-density housing simply is housing that packs more people per geographic unit. For example, <a href=\"https://300main.ca/\">300 Main</a> is a 40-storey apartment building that will be home to several hundred city dwellers. Communities that are urbanizing sometimes encourage developers to add higher-density complexes to their downtown areas. There are many advantages to these tall multiplexes.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6065\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6065\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://300main.ca/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6065\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Final_C2-1024x775.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-300x227.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-770x583.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-500x379.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-293x222.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2-1400x1060.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Final_C2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6065\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">3D Rendering of 300 Main</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Higher-density neighbourhoods have a strong sense of community and connectedness because people are just in closer contact with each other. High-density housing usually entails high-rise buildings such as 300 Main. Higher population density is essential for <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/ypnexthome/high-density-housing-gta_b_17208346.html\">developing busy, vivacious neighbourhoods</a> with lots of features. It allows for beautiful public spaces like downtown Winnipeg to make life convenient, enjoyable and, most importantly, green!</p>\n<h3>Sustainable Design</h3>\n<p>As cities <a href=\"https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2019/04/canadas-major-cities-ride-slipstream-surging-population-growth\">boom in population</a> and invest to meet the needs of their new citizens, sustainability has also become a major focus. High-rise apartments are one of the easiest ways to make a community more sustainable. They have a smaller footprint than that of many smaller buildings.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6069\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6069\" style=\"width: 680px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6069\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg, Chicago, High Rise Buildings in Chicago, High Rise Apartments in Chicago\" width=\"680\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-199x300.jpg 199w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-770x1159.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-500x752.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3-293x441.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/apartment-architectural-design-architecture-bridge-1152849-3.jpg 901w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6069\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chicago, United States by Cameron Casey from Pexels</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If neighbourhoods want to continue to grow, all they need to do is look up! Building up, or even on top of, is <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2012/01/why-most-environmental-building-building-weve-already-built/1016/\">more environmentally-friendly</a> than conventional demolished-site redevelopment.</p>\n<h3>Size Matters (For Energy)</h3>\n<p>Denser neighbourhoods that include apartment blocks or condos also use less energy. Residences that are stacked or bunched should <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/life/homes/modern-housing-why-highrises-are-good-for-the-environment\">use less energy</a>. For example, an apartment suite in 300 Main is more efficient to heat and cool than a detached suburban house. So even on cold winter nights (which us Winnipeggers know sometimes start in October), if every apartment suite were to turn their heat up, they’d be using less energy than the equivalent number of houses. Higher-density neighbourhoods also <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths/\">create fewer harmful emissions</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2012/04/why-bigger-cities-are-greener/863/\">Richard Florida at CityLab</a> says, “When it comes to greenness, <a href=\"http://martinprosperity.org/insights/insight/cities-and-co2-bigger-is-better\">size matters</a>.”</p>\n<h3>Encourages more Walking, Cycling and Use of Public Transportation</h3>\n<p>Though downtown areas can seem busy, there are major benefits to living and working downtown. Dense downtown neighbourhoods help residents drive less and walk more, without giving up their lifestyles. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40492045/living-in-a-dense-city-makes-citizens-healthier\">Research</a> has shown that lower density promotes sedentary behavior. If your home is far away from the grocery store and your office, you’re going to spend more time in a car and less time being active.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Pxt5HlTeqB\"><p><a href=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/\">Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Getting Around Winnipeg without a Car (Yes, it’s Possible!)&#8221; &#8212; Living at 300 Main Downtown Winnipeg\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/getting-around-winnipeg-without-a-car-yes-its-possible/embed/#?secret=Pxt5HlTeqB\" data-secret=\"Pxt5HlTeqB\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>High-density housing encourages walking and cycling <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trying-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-dont-fall-for-these-myths/\">because everything is closer</a> together! Transit is also promoted by high-density housing, as transit connections become more common when neighborhood density increases. Many city dwellers find it more convenient to jump on a transit bus and be at work in a stress-free jiffy, rather than drive to work, deal with traffic, and find parking. Talk about a headache!</p>\n<p>Individuals who live in suburban areas can also benefit from people taking transit to work. Fewer cars on the road equal fewer harmful emissions, like carbon dioxide.</p>\n<h3>What’s Big, Green, and Sustainable?</h3>\n<p>High-density housing is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/jun/30/sustainable-cities-urban-planning\">sustainable choice</a> for growing cities. Tall buildings are more than just towers of concrete and steel; they’re a fundamental part of successful urbanization. They offer a greener, less wasteful, and more energy-efficient way of life.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6072\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6072\" style=\"width: 954px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6072\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-954x1024.jpg\" alt=\"300 Main Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Winnipeg Apartments, Downtown Winnipeg Apartments, Apartment Buildings, Apartments in Winnipeg, New York, New York Apartment Buildings\" width=\"954\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-954x1024.jpg 954w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-279x300.jpg 279w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-770x827.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-500x537.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-293x315.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/vehicles-on-road-between-high-rise-buildings-1525612-1400x1503.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New York, United States by Craig Adderley from Pexels</figcaption></figure></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Canadians are increasingly living in cities, and Winnipeg is no exception.

What we decide to call <em>lasting</em> and <em>classic</em> depends on our ideas of current and vintage trends. It comes from our backgrounds, preferences, and our feelings.</p>\n<p>I might call my yellow sofa timeless, but it might not be something you want to see in your living room every day for the next twenty years. I know why the tweed Chanel suit is considered beautiful and timeless, but it’s just not for me. When it comes to home décor, the same rules apply; each piece of furniture should suit your vision and your lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The point of such a talky introduction was only to get us thinking about and appreciating the things we own. In a fast-paced world full of issues such as climate change, plastic and fast-fashion production, we ought to pay attention to the quality and durability of our clothes and furniture. Building a wardrobe and home centered on timeless pieces will make a positive difference to both your life and the environment. Let’s look at the process of searching for décor that will last.</p>\n<h3>1. Stay away from clichés</h3>\n<p>A home that evokes sighs of admiration with its timeless style wasn&#8217;t decorated in a week. Everything that deserves attention, anything that will last, takes time, love and effort to find. I’m not trying to judge Costco or IKEA. However, I tend to believe in other, more sophisticated and exciting ways of discovering your home essentials.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6038\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, ikea\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-770x513.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-293x195.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ikea-building-1797405-1400x933.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Current trends, which tell us to live more organically and embrace slow-fashion and slow-living, affect our ideas about the right way to shop. There are many ways to avoid mass-produced pieces of furniture to find something that will add character to your place that you’ll treasure and enjoy using.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit flea markets and antique stores, like <a href=\"http://antiquesandfunk.com/\">Antiques &amp; Funk</a> or the <a href=\"https://thejohnstonterminal.com/\">Johnston Terminal Antique Mall</a>. Honestly, what compares to the thrill of finding a chair in Louis XIV style, or a set of old chandeliers to make each dinner and party you host sparkle?<a href=\"https://thejohnstonterminal.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6040 size-large\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, johnston terminal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-770x433.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-500x281.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal-293x165.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/Johnston-Terminal.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></li>\n<li>Try local furniture boutiques. When people hear the word “boutique,” they tend to imagine high-end pieces with high-end prices. But you’d be surprised by the quality you can find at affordable prices My yellow couch, for example, cost just under $600, and the quality and the style are tremendous!</li>\n<li>Frequent local marketplaces that feature artists and makers. These markets, like <a href=\"https://alleywaysmarket.ca/\">Alleyways Market</a> or <a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\">Third + Bird</a>, can be found throughout the year in Winnipeg. Many artists will have examples at their booths that can be pre-ordered or purchased on the spot. I’ve found beautiful wooden side tables, kitchen items made from olive wood, and handmade woven baskets that are great for décor and storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://thirdandbirdevents.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg\" alt=\"third + bird\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original.jpg 800w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-300x150.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-770x385.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-500x250.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-585x293.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/https___cdn.evbuc_.com_images_78161255_101463824605_1_original-293x147.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go treasure hunting at thrift stores and second-hand places. Sure, sometimes you’ll leave empty-handed, but you might also leave with pieces that will suit your style and serve you loyally. Search thrift stores for small details like a magazine stand, books, candelabras or even seasonal decorations. You’ll find unique pieces while doing your part for the environment by reusing, recycling, and restyling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Add culture to your place</h3>\n<p>My great-grandmother was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruska_Roma\">Ruska Roma</a>. Learning this explained a lot about my preferences. Every time I promised myself that I would keep my house minimalistic, and style it simply with bohemian pieces, I would find something a colourful carpet, golden candle holder, or velvet pillow I couldn’t resist.</p>\n<p>Don’t let a fear of being different blind you. Don’t force yourself to follow trends and clichés if you feel no connection to it. I’m not saying to surround yourself with only appropriate cultural pieces. You don’t want your home to be a museum; you want it to be your home that reflects who you are and feels comfortable and warm. Add culture by mixing in art pieces (maybe something you picked up while travelling) with modern furniture for a timeless look.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6045\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style, antique store, bohemian\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/ana-juma-bX-N-0sz8gg-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Imagine a room where the main pieces, like the sofa, chairs, and table, are simple, but the room feels full of character. Look closer, and you will notice more than basic furniture. Is that a rug from India? Are there French impressionist paintings? Photographs? Are there handmade vases from Poland? Discover what your culture is about and sprinkle it throughout your home.</p>\n<h3>3. Let the basics be timeless</h3>\n<p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: everyone has their own interpretation of what makes something timeless. However, there are some standard rules for choosing timeless pieces.</p>\n<p>Allow bigger pieces such as sofas, dining tables, kitchen cabinets, and your bed to be timeless. The same rules that apply in fashion apply to interior design: keep your essential wardrobe and basic furniture functional and timeless. Then, add trendy or cultural notes to it seasonally.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6046\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Timeless decor, home decor, apartment decor, classic decor, modern decor, redecorating, furniture, buying, apartment style\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/samantha-gades-BlIhVfXbi9s-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Timeless furniture makes a functional base but doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. Research the epoch you find the most delightful or interesting and be inspired by its designs. Pay attention to descriptions such as “retro”, “mid-century” and “contemporary”; you might even keep an eye out for “Victorian” if you like a bit of pomp. Use these pieces fearlessly as your basics.</p>\n<p>If cultural or trendy decorative details suit your personality, then timeless furniture is your neutral base. The more timeless and essential your main furniture is, the longer it will stay with you. You merely won&#8217;t get tired of its appearance and presence.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>The advice that helped me: start a mood board (physical or just on Pinterest) and do your research. Collect ideas for timeless (but not dull and boring!) interior design pieces. Then, enjoy the slow thrill of the furniture hunt at antique stores, little unknown shops. Search Instagram for artists and handcrafters; you might find unique dish sets, side tables, pillows and baskets. When you’re finished, your home will be more than just a shelter. It will be full of useful, uncommon pieces that have a story behind them; pieces that serve you and express your individuality.

I had spent months creating Pinterest boards and circling items in Ikea catalogs. As soon as I stepped into my new room, my bubbling excitement quickly fizzled into disgust: lime green walls assaulted my eyes.</p>\n<p>I could feel my beautiful aesthetic daydreams being crushed. Unfortunately, my dormitory wouldn’t let me paint the walls, which is standard in a rental. However, I was determined not to let that hideous colour stop me from having the best dorm room in the hall. Here are my cheap and easy tips to save your style when you’re stuck with unpleasant paint!</p>\n<h3>Tapestry is Your New Best Friend</h3>\n<p>As soon as you add a <a href=\"https://society6.com/tapestries/winnipeg\">tapestry</a> (or your DIYed fabric) onto your wall, what lies underneath is your little secret. This is the easiest way to make an unfortunate wall colour disappear. Plus, you won’t lose your security deposit when it’s time to move.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6019\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6019\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/winnipeg-skyline-yyh_tapestry?sku=s6-8105496p42a55v412\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6019\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art, winnipeg skyline, tapestry\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries.jpg 700w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-100x100.jpg 100w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-500x500.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-293x293.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-390x390.jpg 390w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-585x585.jpg 585w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/winnipeg-skyline-yyh-tapestries-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6019\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winnipeg Skyline Wall Tapestry by MarianVoicu on Etsy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Peel-and-Stick Backsplash Tiles or Wallpaper</h3>\n<p>You can pick these up at the dollar store, <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/decor/wallpaper-and-supplies/wallpaper.html?q=*:relevance:categoryPathHierarchy:3%252Fhd-classes%252Fl1-decor%252Fl2-wallpaper%252Fl3-wallpaper:attributeidWallpApplication2016:Self-Adhesive%252FPeel%2Band%2BStick\">Home Depot</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.wallpops.com/nu1650-birch-tree-peel-and-stick-wallpaper\">online</a>, and they’re super easy to apply! You apply them right on top of the paint. When you’re ready to move or just need a change in backdrop, they peel right off.</p>\n<h3>Cover Every Inch in Art</h3>\n<p>I’m a self-professed clutter bug and love having lots of action on my walls. If that sounds like you, this is the perfect solution to your wall-based conflict! Divide your wall into sections and decorate it with collages of artwork, mirrors and larger décor/paintings. Perhaps your style leans more towards weavings, like this <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/677226640/50-shades?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;frs=1\">cool piece from Winnipeg artist Rebecca Riel</a>.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6012\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6012\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6012\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/lena-malevitis-_Kn4EGbLqGo-unsplash.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Lena Malevitis from Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Use Complementary Colours</h3>\n<p>This ties in with covering the wall in art. It might seem difficult to compliment a colour you hate, but this tip can really add to your décor. For example, to deal with my lime green walls I added muted and neutral tones. I used black and white photographs, a darker green tapestry and a mocha-coloured mirror. Even though I was working with the colour of the wall, it worked with my style and drew more attention to it.</p>\n<p>For help finding colour inspiration, <a href=\"https://www.architecturelab.net/\">www.architecturelab.net</a> is a great resource.</p>\n<h3>Reflect with a Mirror</h3>\n<p>A sculptural <a href=\"https://www.picturesframesandmore.com/mirrors/page-id-166/Decorative/\">mirror</a> is a great, eye-pleasing way to direct attention away from the wall. For starters, mirrors are wonderful for <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/10-ways-to-use-mirrors-to-make-113181\">making rooms appear bigger</a> and illuminating your space. They’re also great for directing attention! Your guests will be more prone to looking at themselves in the mirror than to notice what it’s hiding.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6014\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6014\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6014\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1024x749.jpg\" alt=\"wall painting, accent wall, tapestry, wallpaper, apartment decor, decorating, interior design, apartment style, boho-style apartment, boho-style wall, apartment living, renting an apartment, wall art\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1024x749.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-300x219.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-770x563.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-500x366.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-293x214.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/11/round-brown-framed-mirror-with-reflection-of-curtain-1587597-1400x1024.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">? by Erin Profaci from Pexels</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Make Another Wall the Focus</h3>\n<p>I found myself putting a lot of effort into the wall adjacent to the lime green fiasco. That way, when guests came into my room their attention was immediately drawn to the cool photos on the other wall. I also hung lights around the space.</p>\n<h3>Add Greenery</h3>\n<p>Adding a couple <a href=\"https://www.verdeywg.shop/product/ctenanthe-lubbersiana/449?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=false&amp;category_id=2\">tall potted plants</a> beside a wall is one of the easiest ways to direct attention away from the wall behind.

Now that sparks joy!</p>\n<h3>Why Thrift?</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Environmental impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>Every thrifted item means one less new one produced, which is important because the production of each household item is costly to the environment. By choosing to thrift your household items, you’re helping divert used goods from landfills. Value Village alone diverts over 700 million pounds from landfills annually!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5988\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5988\" style=\"width: 580px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://bozemanmagazine.com/articles/2016/04/01/26026_upholstery_in_the_maker_space\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5988\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments, furniture waste, furniture in landfills\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine.jpg 580w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-500x333.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/From-Bozeman-Magazine-293x195.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo from an article titled Upholstery in the Maker Space, Bozeman Magazine</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><em><strong>Social impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>Thrift stores make it easier to know where your money is going. For instance, one of Winnipeg’s most popular thrift stores, <a href=\"https://www.valuevillage.com/\">Value Village</a>, donates a large portion of their proceeds back into the community.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personal impact</strong></em></p>\n<p>My favorite item in my downtown apartment is a unique, red oak coffee table that I copped from <a href=\"http://canadiangoodwill.ca/\">Goodwill</a> for just $12! Amazed by my deal, I looked online—similar items sold for $150. Need I say more?</p>\n<h3>How to Shop Secondhand Décor</h3>\n<p>Friendly reminder that when you buy used, you’re technically sharing with the previous owners. Check fabric and upholstered pieces carefully before making your purchase. Always check for M.O.P.S: mildew, odors, pests and stains!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shop prepared</strong></em></p>\n<p>Knowing the measurements of the room you want to decorate is key! There’s nothing worse than coming home with your dream rug only to realize it’s way too big for your space. Measure the room beforehand, write the measurements down, and bring a measuring tape with you when you go shopping. These simple precautions will save you so much hassle.</p>\n<p>Focus on key pieces first, rather than browsing everything. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when thrifting. You might be on a mission for a coffee table but end up lost among dozens of decorative mirrors.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Look for potential, not perfection</strong></em></p>\n<p>Thrifted goods likely won’t look perfect when you purchase them, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t right for your space.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5990\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"thrift store, thrifting, shopping for furniture, furniture shopping for your apartment, apartment living winnipeg, 300 Main downtown winnipeg apartments\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-770x514.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-500x334.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-370x247.jpg 370w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-293x196.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/alexandra-gorn-JIUjvqe2ZHg-unsplash-1400x935.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Know your style</strong></em></p>\n<p>Combining a variety of decorating styles can be a cool, edgy look, but only when done carefully. Avoid decorating seasickness by carefully considering two questions: What’s your existing style, and what colour scheme are you going for?</p>\n<p>You’re decorating a space that you’ll be spending a lot of time in. Make sure you like the items you bring into your space and that they reflect your personal style. You’re doing no one any good by decorating the space in fads and trends that you really don’t truly like. And having an assortment of colours and furniture can be a pretty, eccentric look, but there should always be an overall colour scheme to keep your room cohesive.</p>\n<h3>What to Buy New</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Mattress</strong></em></p>\n<p>When it comes to mattress shopping, I have two words for you: bed bugs! A mattress is one of the most important things to buy after signing the lease to your new apartment. I think it goes without saying that buying a used mattress is a no-no. Bed bugs are great hitchhikers!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Crib</strong></em></p>\n<p>Having a baby is expensive, but a crib is not something you should want to skimp on. Buying a used crib is risky, because you don’t know what type of internal damage there might be.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pet furniture</strong></em></p>\n<p>You have no way of knowing what previous pets were up to on second-hand pet beds, crates, blankets or toys. To ensure your furry friend has a clean and safe place to sit or sleep, avoid buying pet items second-hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer thrifting or buying new for your apartment?

Even if it’s not your favourite thing, choose furniture carefully to ensure you have a happy, comfortable abode. There is no one style that will suit everyone, so let’s look at some things you should consider before you furnish your digs.</p>\n<h3>The Living Room</h3>\n<p>We’ll start in the living room or family room. You’ve got options when it comes to your furniture upholstery, such as leather, wood or fabric. What will work best for you depends on a few factors.</p>\n<p>Nice furnishings don’t always mix well with children or clawed pets. If you have small children or a feline who loves to scratch, you might want to save yourself some heartache and avoid expensive materials like leather.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5964\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-300x225.jpg 300w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-770x577.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-500x375.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-293x220.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_4018-1400x1050.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should also consider the temperature you tend to keep your home at. If you like thing on the warm side, be aware that leather can stick to bare skin. There’s nothing fun about the sting that follows peeling your body off leather furniture. On the other hand, leather is durable and comfy to sink into. For the vegans or vegetarians among you, leather is likely out, so you may want to consider <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vimle-sofa-with-chaise-farsta-dark-brown-s79206994/\">artificial leather</a> or a different type of upholstery.</p>\n<p>Wood can be nice for some furnishings, but you don’t want an entire couch made of it. (Imagine trying to take an afternoon nap on that.) Wood can stand up to Fluffy and her talons, though, so you might look for couches and chairs that pair wood frames with fabric coverings if you have a particularly-destructive cat. Wood gives a room a nice look and has great durability. I have cube-shaped, solid-wood end tables that I can stand on. They’re great for when my short frame needs to dust high places. Places like <a href=\"https://www.biglowwoodcraft.com/\">Biglow Woodcraft</a> make beautiful pieces right here in Winnipeg.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5961\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"681\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-770x1157.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-500x751.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-293x440.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/angelo-pantazis-rXDAVb7tvA-unsplash-1400x2104.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" /></p>\n<p>Cost is another factor when we decide what to buy. Leather and wood tend to be more expensive than fabric, so they might end up out of your price range. When considering cost, think about how long you intend to have that piece of furniture. Some people want to buy something and use it forever, and others like to change up their décor regularly. You may want to spend a bit less if you can’t see yourself liking the same desk or chair for years; you’ll want to replace it eventually.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5966\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/stephanie-harvey-PPA6wsuedeM-unsplash-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>The size of your space also plays a major role in your furniture shopping. You might love the idea of a gigantic sectional so all your friends can come over and watch Jets games, but a sectional won’t work in a tiny apartment. Instead, you might choose something like this <a href=\"https://www.thesefourwalls.ca/sofas-sectionals/axis-sofa\">plush-looking condo sofa</a>. My home is small, so we’ve gotten good at picking up furniture that fits in our space. Some people look at Ikea with disdain, but it’s a great place to find <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/rooms_ideas/small_spaces/index.html\">pieces designed for small spaces</a>. We wanted a futon for our spare bedroom/office, but the room doesn’t have space for a double-sized futon. Ikea came to our rescue with a <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/vallentuna-sleeper-module-with-backrests-hillared-light-blue-s49277488/\">chair futon</a> that folds out into a single bed. It’s also super comfy!</p>\n<p>You can look for other furniture that does double duty. We store cooking magazines inside an <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/product/fay-storage-ottoman--alexa-steel-212122.html?cgid=LIVING-SEATING-OTTOMANSBENCHES#sz=12&amp;start=21\">ottoman that opens up to double as storage</a>. Floating shelves look good and provide storage for books and knick-knacks.</p>\n<h3>The Dining Experience</h3>\n<p>Does your dining room table simply act as a repository for your mail and random objects? Or do you fancy yourself a chef and do a lot of entertaining? If you’re more the chef type, choose your table wisely. Will you have enough room for your friends and family to gather around?</p>\n<p>Look for a table that extends if you sometimes need to serve a larger group. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.designmanitoba.com/store/p2052/Nexus_Extendable_table_by_Amisco.html\">extendable tables</a> are not all equal. How easy is it to extend/collapse? Do you have to store the extra leaf somewhere else? We bought a great table from <a href=\"https://www.urbanbarn.com/en/home/\">Urban Barn</a> a few years ago. It extends so we can host a crowd, and one person can set up the extension without help. The extra leaf butterflies and folds down under the table, so we don’t have to store it anywhere else in our already-tight space. It’s a far cry from the tables of old that needed (at least) two people and an engineering degree to add or remove a huge leaf, which took up valuable storage space when not in use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5968\" src=\"https://livingat300main.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"furniture shopping, apartment living, downtown winnipeg apartments, apartments in winnipeg, furniture shopping in Winnipeg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-225x300.jpg 225w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-770x1027.jpg 770w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-500x667.jpg 500w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-293x391.jpg 293w, https://arwebstore.blob.core.windows.net/livingat300main-ca/2019/10/IMG_6104-1400x1867.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Pay attention to your <a href=\"https://www.thebrick.com/collections/furniture-dining-room-chairs\">dining chairs</a>, too. Do people often linger at your table? If so, choose chairs that can be comfortable for a few hours. When we bought our table, we had the option of purchasing coordinating benches that would have seated 3 people each. They were beautiful, solid wood benches—and horribly uncomfortable. We found wood-framed chairs with leather upholstery instead, so our guests don’t need to visit the chiropractor after dining with us.</p>\n<p>Chairs also allow you to show off your personal style. You can choose chairs all in the same subdued hue or add a bit of flair and a pop of colour! We had 4 different colour options when we bought our dining chairs and couldn’t decide which we liked better. So we bought 2 of each colour! Our <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\">mismatched chairs</a> add a bit of whimsy to our slate grey table.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px; border: #eee 1px solid;\" src=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mismatched-dining-chairs-262815\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Technology Can Help You Decide</h3>\n<p>When looking for furniture, you can download a room design app to help you decide what you want! It’s fun to virtually plan out a room to see what it might look like and what will fit. With the right app, you can do more than use your imagination when you are trying to decide what works and doesn’t. Here’s an article that links to some <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-7-best-apps-for-room-design-amp-room-layout-244213\">popular room design apps you can try</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d still recommend going to showrooms, since look and size are only part of the picture when it comes to choosing furniture. I’m always most concerned with comfort and practicality in my furniture, but you can choose to go entirely online for your furniture buying. Either way, take the time to do your research and think about what you truly need. Buying furniture is far more expensive than buying clothes and you’ll be living with your decisions for a long time. Don’t get stuck with buyer’s remorse when it comes to your furniture!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Where is your favourite place to shop for furniture in Winnipeg?
